Archive_Text_010101,"My body is getting worse these days, probably the age. Managing the Vault is a painstaking job. Only these Overseer-exclusive fine cigars and wines can provide some solace to my weary mind.\nThe admin computer has started the selection protocol for the next Overseer. I don't know what selection criteria this Vault-Tec computer is based on, but I don't have the right to complain, because it was how I got elected.\nIt's a shame that Selina, who has been a loyal servant to me for 19 years, is not in the admin computer's list of candidates. Maybe I can designate her a new position as compensation."
Archive_Text_010104,"I can obviously feel my body changing these days. I can take it so far, but am not sure how much longer I can last...\nI have to find a way to cure myself before my body totally loses control, or at least slow down this degradation. Just buy me a little more time, I might have the chance.\nSunshine Tidings Co-Op is not far away. They say the terminals there store a lot of information, maybe I can find out what I need.\nHope all is well, for me and for the Vault. My successor... I believe they can do this!"
Archive_Text_010105,"Arcjet Systems is a cutting-edge research institute specialized in aerospace equipment and technology. Besides the office buildings and laboratories, there is a towering wind tunnel built for testing large propellers.\nAlthough this facility has been deserted since the Great War, its security system is still running. The defensive firepower made up of Protectrons and Auto-turrets are able to defeat any Raiders that attempt to break in."
Archive_Text_010106,"The location of the Institute's headquarter is one of the biggest mysteries on the Commonwealth Wasteland. Some think it is beneath the ruins of C.I.T., because they provide the best cover for those who need to hide their presence. No intruders can clear the ruins for real.\nIn fact, this is what the Institute wants people to think. A decoy so large and so tangled in rumors, it is a reflection of the fear that the Institute has stricken into the hearts of the settlers of the Commonwealth."
Archive_Text_010107,"Graygarden is a full-automatic farm managed by robots. The prided work of Dr. Edward Gray, it has withstood nuclear destruction and various dangers on the Wasteland and been running till this day, making it a perfect example of self-sustained farm of the future.\nYou can find almost all crops that grow on the Wasteland here - mutfruit, potato, corn, melon, gourd and Razorgrain, etc."
Archive_Text_010108,"This building was a research institute of intelligent anti-radiation materials. It suffered from serious damage when the bombs fell. Fortunately it's main body still stands.\nAlthough all the researchers here died many years ago, the robots inside still meticulously follow the commands given by the organization. They even broadcast ""hiring"" information to attract Wasteland Dwellers to come here, who eventually become test subjects of these crazy robots.\nRumor says the materials being developed here were planned to be used on power armor, bolstering the wearer's radiation protection."
Archive_Text_010109,"All this time, I have traveled to many places and investigated any documents I can find. Given the limited time I had by then, I am happy I made the right decision.\nSo my situation is pretty clear. But a Vault without the Resource Purifier. may get into trouble. If I can find the technology and equipment to replace Resource Purifier....\nFortunately, Vault-Tec HQ is located in east Boston, which is not far away. Hope I can find it there..."
Archive_Text_020101,"At the age of 17, Preston Garvey joined the Minutemen as a soldier under Colonel Hollis. As an avid believer in the justice of the Minutemen, he was quickly promoted to sergeant under the direct command of Colonel Hollis."
Archive_Text_020102,"After the Quincy Massacre, Preston gathered the remaining civilians of Quincy and loyal members of the Minutemen and fled to Jamaica Plain. But they were pursued up by the Gunners led by Clint. Several of the refugees were killed, the rest of them made it to Lexington, where, unfortunately, was filled with Feral Ghouls. The hardships they had through the town reduced the number of their group to ten. Eventually they arrived at Concord and took shelter in the Museum of Freedom, only to find themselves under attack by a group of Raiders. By now, there were only 5 members of them left."
Archive_Text_020103,"Nate's appearance helped Preston save the Minutemen. After appointing Nate to the new general, Preston gradually expanded the Minutemen's influence and protected settlements that advocate their vision."
Archive_Text_020201,"Ronnie Shaw is a veteran soldier of the Minutemen, former administrator of the armory. She is familiar with the Castle and artillery.\nAfter the collapse of the Minutemen, Ronnie Shaw had to live in seclusion to avoid the Gunners until the Castle was taken back by the Minutemen.

Giving him sufficient materials and schematics, he can even build a teleportation device that is extremely complicated.\nSturges is one of the survivors of Quincy.

Its front was almost shattered, the unburied part formed a 30-40 degree with the ground. The wreckage is scattered everywhere.\nThere were corpses lying around, roughly five feet long, humanoid creatures with large heads and eyes. Three were thrown out of the aircraft, two remained inside, partly burned.\nWe put on radiation suits in case of contamination. We put the bodies into boxes and on the ambulance. The corpses were transported to Andrews AFB."

Archive_Text_030101,The Minutemen was originally a civilian militia founded by various communities to defend against monsters from the Glowing Sea.\nThey established multiple outposts across the Commonwealth and grew stronger as more and more civilians joined their force. They first gained their reputation by successfully defending Diamond City from a Super Mutant attack in 2180.
Archive_Text_030102,"Later, the Minutemen controlled Fort Independence on Castle Island, Boston, and transformed it into their main base, renaming it the Castle. They set up a radio station and install cannons in the fort to communicate with and reinforce Minutemen members across the Commonwealth. At this point, the Minutemen had become one of the most reliable military forces of the Commonwealth."
Archive_Text_030103,"In 2247, a colony of Mirelurks attacked the Castle, led by a Mirelurk queen who wanted to build their nest there. The unprepared Minutemen descended into chaos and was forced to abandon the Fort. Their leader, General McGann, locked himself up in the armory and eventually died of dehydration.\nBy 2282, after the last leader of the Minutemen, General Becker, was killed, the organization burst into internal strife for they could not reach a consensus on the successor, which eventually led to the tragedy of Quincy Massacre."
Archive_Text_030104,"In 2287, besieged by the Gunners, the Quincy settlers requested aid from the Minutemen. The Minutemen, a group of soldiers led by Colonel Hollis, were dispatched there and reached a stalemate with the Gunners. Without other Minutemen units responding to their requests of back-up, and due to the betrayal of the defector, Clint, nearly all of the Minutemen and the settlers in Quincy were killed except Preston and a few survivors, who barely managed to escape the town.\nThe Quincy Massacre marked the end of the old Minutemen. Most of the members disbanded and even turned to Raiderry. The only one that did not give up hope is Preston, leading the survivors to escape from the Gunners' pursuits while searching for a new base for the Minutemen."
Archive_Text_030105,"At the Museum of Freedom, Preston was saved by Nate, with whose help, he was able to rebuild the Minutemen at Sanctuary Hills. Step by step, they repelled Raiders in the Commonwealth, built settlements, opened trading routes, and reclaimed the Castle.\nUnder the leadership of their new general, the reborn Minutemen are now stronger than ever and has become the most important force to maintaining order and rebuilding civilization in the Commonwealth."
Archive_Text_030201,"The Brotherhood of Steel was founded by Roger Maxson, a captain in the U.S. Army. After the Great War, he led the troops at Mariposa Military Base and their families to transfer to the fallout shelter of Lost Hills. With heavy casualties inflicted during the two week journey, they made it to the destination and thrived.\nMaxson established this paramilitary force, the Brotherhood of Steel, aiming to rebuild civilization - no matter the cost, and set their headquarter in the bunker of Lost Hills.\nIn the early years after their foundation, the Brotherhood set preservation and control of technology as their highest goal. Having witnessed the crime committed in the name of science by pre-war mankind, the Brotherhood rejects sharing technology with the outside and thinks themselves as the last reserves of human technology."
Archive_Text_030202,"The early development of the Brotherhood was very smooth. With advanced pre-war technologies such as power armor, energy weapons and super computers, they took control of the surrounding areas of Lost Hills, eradicated the Raiders and built trading routes with the Hub, one of the communities rebuilt after the war.\nBut in their development, the Brotherhood's disregard of anything outside technology (and technologies they deem useless in battle) has made them neglect many important things, even including their own history.\nThe conservative approach and ideologies of the Brotherhood was questioned by many, resulting in a fraction of the members split from the organization. Despite that, the Brotherhood was still the most technologically-advanced group in the Wasteland."
Archive_Text_030203,"But after several years, the Brotherhood encountered an enemy far stronger than Raiders. In the October of 2161, a recon squad stumbled upon a dead Super Mutant. After studying the corpse, they realized a powerful threat is drawing near.\nIn 2162, the Vault-Dweller arrived at the Lost Hills, seeking to join the Brotherhood. But he was not taken seriously, and as if dispatching a fool, he was told to complete a test at the Glow, a pre-war scientific research facility that was hit by a nuclear bomb and became an irradiated death trap. To the surprise of everyone, not only did the Vault-Dweller return safely, but he had also succeeded the task and recovered holotapes of paladins who dead in there. \despite the protests of some key members of the Brotherhood, the Vault-Dweller became the first outsider to be accepted into the order, and helped them defeat the Master's Super Mutant army and destroy their headquarter, Mariposa Military Base(ironically, no member of the Brotherhood knew that this is the place of origin of their organization)."
Archive_Text_030204,"After defeating the Master, the Brotherhood members began arguing about whether to share technology with outsiders. In the end, the Elders decided to forbid technology-sharing, insisted that the Brotherhood should survive on their traditional principles. Those who opposed this rule were sent eastward by airships to pursue the remnants of the Master's army. These opposition faction later formed a new chapter of the Brotherhood.\nMeanwhile, tension was increasing in Brotherhood's relationship with the expanding New California Republic. The Lost Hills bunker was encircled by the state of Maxson. Although the bunker remained under the control of the Brotherhood, the surrounding areas were completely in the hands of the NCR.\nBy 2242, the Brotherhood was no longer as powerful as it used to be. As the Enclave returned to the Wasteland, the Brotherhood had technological advantage no more. They could merely monitor the Enclave's actions from their bunker nearby. Fortunately, with the destruction of the Enclave Oil Rig by the Chosen One, together with the NCR's attack, the Enclave was no longer a threat to the Brotherhood. And the Brotherhood finally acquired the Enclave's Vertibird schematics from the Chosen One."

Tutorial_20000001,"Dear Overseer, If the map we got from Diamond City is real, there should be plenty of pre-war supplies in this building."
Tutorial_20000002,"But according to our reconnaissance, the Raiders have taken the place, and they won't surrender the supplies without a fight."
Tutorial_20000003,Please command your troops to advance and prepare for the fight. These Raiders are armed to teeth and we must treat them with caution!
Tutorial_20000004,"Darn it, their defenses are too strong! We must use stronger weapons --"
Tutorial_20000005,"Well done, however, we didn't expect that there would be so many enemies here. We should lay out the bombs to kill them faster."
Tutorial_20000006,"It takes a bit of risk, but if we don't wipe out the Raiders, their reinforcements will kill us."
Tutorial_20000007,The bomb is going to explode! Everyone please be ready for the blast!
Tutorial_20000008,"The enemies here should have been killed, but we still can't lower our guard yet. The materials we need should be in the Raiders main quarters."
Tutorial_20000009,"Please take a careful inventory of the materials and equipment here. After we collect everything, we can go back to the Vault and start working."
Tutorial_20000010,"According to the materials we brought back, we can now build a nuclear power generator in the Vault. It is completely safe and doesn't leak radiation!"
Tutorial_20000011,Good news! The nuclear power generator has been successfully completed and the power of the Vault has been restored. You light up the Vault!
Tutorial_00000001,"Overseer, the Vault runs on dwellers who can both venture out and help with production."
Tutorial_00000002,"Sturges is better at this production of Vault, mechanic being his job, and he will be the main man in building our Vault."
Tutorial_00000003,Well well... I mean I can fix this Vault for you though it sounds difficult.
Tutorial_00000004,"While Deacon is good at dealing with a large number of enemies, he can also help with electricity production of the Vault."
Tutorial_00000005,It seems that you have found me. I can help you solve the troublesome monsters. Give me any task.
Tutorial_00000006,"To sum up, Mr. Overseer, each dweller has different expertise. These indicate that they specialize in a variety of different jobs."
Tutorial_00000007,"...... Anyway, due to the aging of the reactor, we need to send Deacon to the nuclear power generator. As I said before."
Tutorial_00000008,"Um...... It seems that due to the miscalculation we are still in a state of insufficient power. You may need to speed up production again.,"
Tutorial_00000009,"Since we need to use a certain amount of Caps for the construction of the Vault, please build a Caps recycling station."
Tutorial_0000000901,Please note that Caps are also used as a common currency in the Wasteland and you can switch to accelerated construction mode to get it done quickly.
Tutorial_00000010,"You did a good job! After that, I will use the task panel to provide the guidance for the construction of the Vault. You can follow my advice when you develop and build the Vault."
Tutorial_00000011,"By scientific sorting, I have displayed different types of tasks on the task panel so you can search on demand."
Tutorial_00000013,"Although the Vault is with basic production facilities, our total resource production is low, so we need to strengthen the production efficiency of dwellers."
Tutorial_0000001301,"Therefore, we need to build a training room so that dwellers can improve their expertise level through training. Thus improving the resource production of the corresponding room."
Tutorial_00000014,Great job with the improvement of the expertise level! Sturges can now produce more resources.
Tutorial_0000001401,"Overseer, Please remember that the ability of dwellers is closely related to the process of Vault construction!"
Tutorial_00000016,"Please note that going out on an adventure, will consume purified water as a supply. We must first build a Water Treatment Plant to be self-sufficient."
Tutorial_00000018,This is done. If you drink dirty water in the Wasteland you may get radiation sickness or poisoning.
Tutorial_00000019,"Overseer, after preparing the appropriate supplies, we can set up a team to explore the Wasteland!"
Tutorial_00000020,"Please drag the dweller you wish to send to the Overseer's office, where they will gather and receive the Quest briefing."
Tutorial_00000021,"Overseer, our dweller is ready. The sun has risen and we are about to see the outside world for the first time!"
Tutorial_00000022,The action will consume a certain amount of purified water. You will be asked to plan your adventure according to optimal consumption.
Tutorial_00000023,"Overseer, by taking Quests we have obtained the necessary supplies. Now please return to the Vault to take stock."
Tutorial_00000024,"Overseer, please calm down. We can now see what surprises there are in these pre-war supplies."
Tutorial_00000025,"Here is the Vault radio center. Correspondence has been established and the signal is good. With this, we can now explore a broader area."
Tutorial_00000026,The danger of the Commonwealth Wasteland is far greater than we can imagine. We must replace the scrap equipment of the dwellers with the more formidable equipment.
Tutorial_00000027,When you need to optimize the output of the Vault room or adjust its defense you can do so by adjusting the room location.
Tutorial_00000028,"You can only swap rooms of the same size, or place the selected room in a free space where you can connect. Other operations will cause the Vault system to collapse."
Tutorial_00000029,"The only place that seemed slightly safe, but much less safe than our Vault, was the Minutemen Camp. Well, we can label it as a power point on the map."
Tutorial_00000030,We can get prestige points after completing the Quest. We can use the prestige currency at stores in power points to redeem the necessary supplies and dwellers.
Tutorial_00000031,Warning or good news! We found other Vaults in the Commonwealth Wasteland. Now we can get much-needed supplies through them.
Tutorial_00000032,"Well done, Overseer! We have gained currency by attacking and now please go to the Minutemen Camp to redeem the goods we need."
Tutorial_00000033,Big news! An underground casino in the Neighboring Town ranks the battles among Vaults and wage a bet.
Tutorial_00000034,"They will reward Vaults according to their ranks. We may just fetch a small fortune . Now, let's check out the current season and rewards."
Tutorial_00000035,Our dwellers can systematically enhance their multi-faceted capabilities by training in the training room in accordance with pre-war scientific standards.
Tutorial_00000036,"Overseer, through training expertise, we can greatly improve the production and combat efficiency of the Vault."
Tutorial_00000037,"The bad news is that when you are out, a team of Raiders from a nearby Vault plundered us. Here is the report on the damage."
Tutorial_00000038,"Good news, though, I tracked and determined the location of the Raiders Vault. If you wish, we can now seek revenge!"
Tutorial_00000039,"Overseer, the robot factory has been completed. Please arm our shelter and let's send the Raiders, who are trying to attack our Vault, to their deaths!"
Tutorial_00000040,"Eye bots are ready! You can send them to the room with slot in accordance with the strategic concept, and they will immediately call for our army after discovering the enemy."
Tutorial_00000041,"With the completion of the medical bay, we can send a suitable dweller to work as a doctor. This will significantly increase our speed of curing radiation."
Tutorial_00000042,"Our soldiers are exposed to radiation, but you won't have to worry with this room. The radiation will fade over time."
Tutorial_00000043,"Overseer, the security room ensures that the surrounding rooms are free from the depredations of the invaders, but it cannot be maintained if it is occupied by the Raider."
Tutorial_00000044,"General Overseer, we can view the defense forces in the Vault in defense mode. This includes the deployment of dwellers and robots."
Tutorial_00000045,"In order to facilitate your observation, I will illuminate rooms for which defensive units have been deployed."
Tutorial_00000047,Urgent news! One Deathclaw broke into Concord! Everyone be ready for the battle ! or --
Tutorial_00000048,"Dear Overseer, please note that next Incident is very difficult for us. Please be ready for the battle."
Tutorial_00000049,Continuous upgrades to the dweller's equipment can make you fearless of any challenge. Just like the pre-war countries.
Tutorial_00000050,"By clicking on a specific room, you can view the corresponding seismic impact range. This will help to better create a defensive layout."
Tutorial_00000051,"After the reconstruction, please do not forget to save! I do not think you want to see your design destroyed because of your negligence."
Tutorial_00000052,"Mr. Overseer, please note that we can train the dweller quickly if we use a certain amount of food."
Tutorial_00000053,I hear you're recruiting residents? Very good! My cottage has just been occupied by a gang of Triggermen .
Tutorial_00000054,But your Vault looks like a slum! Living here appears to be torture.
Tutorial_00000055,"Seems I have to deal with it myself. On my way here, I saw some prewar trinkets on Sanctuary Hills. Get the clean water ready. I don't want to get any radiation or something."
Tutorial_00000056,"Thank you, to the Minutemen, for all the help. As a reward, you can obtain the corresponding supplies and equipment in our camp. Rebuilding the Wasteland requires us to work together."
Tutorial_00000057,"Overseer, Mr. Deacon has the expertise to increase power output. This means that if we put him in a nuclear fusion core power station, he can increase the production of corresponding resources."
Tutorial_00000058,"Congratulations, Overseer, you have just unlocked the check-in system. You can get a quantitative reward if you manage the shelter every day."
Tutorial_30000001,"With this advanced past technology, Eagle Eye, we can acquire information on very important enemies, this means their scouting and back-up radius."
Tutorial_30000002,"By using a special sound wave for scouting, I have located the enemy's eyebot, please look out for red sound wave marks."
Tutorial_30000003,"I retrieved some data we collected before on eyebots, you can look at their sound wave range by clicking on the enemy's eyebot."
Tutorial_30000004,"Hm, the enemies are within range of the eyebot's sound wave. They will come to assist the moment the sound wave is detected."
Tutorial_30000005,"According to our current situation, out best option is to defeat the enemy's reinforcement so we won't be surrounded by them"
Tutorial_30000006,"Overseer, this sensing robot is like a phone, it can transmit sound waves to other sensing robots"
Tutorial_30000007,"Darn it, the enemy has put a lot of sensors in this area, looks like we will have to destroy them before we start exploring."
Tutorial_30000008,"For example, once the enemies receive a signal from the sensors, they will come to reinforce the enemies we're fighting with immediately"
Tutorial_30000009,"Go ahead, we need to destroy these enemies!"
Tutorial_300001,"All right, <playername>, there are lots of things you need to learn! Let me teach you some basic know-hows."
Tutorial_300002,Sanctuary Hills must be located here. Let's select the destination and set out.
Tutorial_300003,"First, you need to learn how to run a Vault. The <color=#2b669d>Overseer's Office</color> is where we run and develop the Vault."
Tutorial_300004,"<playername>, we've received another message from the Radio Studio. It came from... some kind of trader, probably... Let's hear what it has to say."
Tutorial_300005,"By the way, the Resource Purifier is here, in the Overseer's office, it is an important device used for controlling the Vault's resource consumption and production."
Tutorial_300006,"First, the <color=#2b669d>Electricity</color> supply of the Vault is very important. <color=#2b669d>All rooms in the Vault depend on Electricity</color>."
Tutorial_300007,"All right, <color=#2b669d>let's activate the Building System</color>..."
Tutorial_300008,"Open the <color=#2b669d>Building List</color>, and build a <color=#2b669d>Power Generator</color>."
Tutorial_300009,Select a suitable location and <color=#2b669d>make sure the rooms are connected to each other</color>.
Tutorial_300010,"It takes some time to build a room. When the <color=#2b669d>construction duration is less than 2 minutes</color>, you can ask the workers to <color=#2b669d>Rush Construction</color>."
Tutorial_300011,"<color=#2b669d>There are other Dwellers in the Vault,</color> to think of. You ought to learn how to organize and manage them all."
Tutorial_300012,"All right, <color=#2b669d> assign the Dwellers to work</color> now."
Tutorial_300013,Thanks for your help. Now let's take a look at the map. There should be a map somewhere...
Tutorial_300014,"<color=#2b669d>Each Dweller has their own Perk</color>. Assign someone to do the job they are good at, the efficiency will improve greatly!"
Tutorial_300015,Where do you view the Perks? Right over here...
Tutorial_300016,These are their <color=#2b669d>work efficiency</color> evaluations.
Tutorial_300017,"We have now <color=#2b669d>completed an assignment</color>, and this dweller can work at the power station."
Tutorial_300018,Sounds interesting... Perhaps we can get some real good stuff from this trader.
Tutorial_300019,"If the Vault is facing an <color=#2b669d>Electricity</color> shortage and we don't have a lot of time to wait, we have an emergency solution."
Tutorial_300020,<color=#2b669d>Rush to generate Electricity</color>!
Tutorial_300021,"This way, the Vault immediately gets a lot of Electricity."
Tutorial_300022,"However, overloading the equipment like this will damage it. <color=#2b669d>Each room can only Rush production three times per day</color>, be warned!"
Tutorial_300023,"Next, I will teach you how to improve the Dweller work efficiency."
Tutorial_300024,"All right, the vendor has just sent us their commodity info. Let's check it out."
Tutorial_300025,"Build a <color=#2b669d>Training Room</color> and send Dwellers into training. When their <color=#2b669d>combat levels are higher, they will have an easier time fighting monsters</color>."
Tutorial_300026,Training Room is ready. Time for a workout!
Tutorial_300027,"Mind you, <color=#2b669d>training costs Food</color>. So it is up to us to make each session count!"
Tutorial_300028,A Dweller has completed a training session and <color=#2b669d>consumed Food</color>.
Tutorial_300029,"If there is not enough Food, the training cannot proceed."
Tutorial_300030,We also will need a constant supply of <color=#2b669d>Food</color>. Open the construction menu and select the <color=#2b669d>Diner</color>.
Tutorial_300031,You can arrange more sessions if you have more food.
Tutorial_300032,"But given the current condition of our Training Room, we can't expect too much from our Dwellers."
Tutorial_300033,"You can use some efficiency boost, too. I'll teach you how to <color=#2b669d>quickly arrange your Dwellers</color>. Watch and learn..."
Tutorial_300034,Fast and simple. Practice makes perfect.
Tutorial_300035,"Oh, is the second monster den also cleared? Impressive so far, rookie."
Tutorial_300036,Check the <color=#2b669d>Quest List</color> for the rest. I've listed the final important item of the evaluation in your <color=#2b669d>Quest List</color>.
Tutorial_300037,"If you are able to complete the requirements in the Quest List and finish the exam, you will be deemed a qualified Overseer."
Tutorial_300038,"You've completed them all? Well, these tests are meant to be easy. But, a good job nonetheless!"
Tutorial_300039,"Well done, <playername>. The central command terminal's report suggests that you have done an outstanding job."
Tutorial_300040,Keep up the momentum. You will be an excellent Overseer some day!
Tutorial_300041,You must be tired now. Get a good night's rest as tomorrow will be a long day.
Tutorial_300042,Sacre bleu! Why is the door open? The Overseer is gone! And so is the Resource Purifier! And we've been left in the hands of this rookie?? Lord give us the strength...
Tutorial_300043,"W...wait! Who are the armed men at the door? What are they doing? Since you... you are the Overseer now, I'll let you do the talking... I'll organize our defenses just in case"
Tutorial_300044,"Hello, don't be afraid. We are the Minutemen and we mean no harm. We just happened by when we heard some noises so we came to investigate and offer assistance."
Tutorial_300045,"Be assured, we are not Raiders. If you need some help, we will give you what we can... After all, I can see that something is wrong with your Vault."
Tutorial_300046,"Well, my friend Sturges is an engineer. He can fix anything!"
Tutorial_300047,"No problem. If it is a mere technical issue, I can take care of it."
Tutorial_300048,"All right, I am going to do a perimeter check - I'll be back as soon as it's been secured. Sturges, you handle the rest."
Tutorial_300049,"Copy that, boss."
Tutorial_300050,What happened? Aren't these guys Raiders?
Tutorial_300051,"We are no Raiders, we are, The Minutemen!"
Tutorial_300052,"What are you doing here, then?"
Tutorial_300053,Your Vault door seems to be faulty and I am here to help fix in in order to main this Vault's safety and security.
Tutorial_300054,"And, what the verdict?"
Tutorial_300055,"The entrance itself is not damaged, except some burn marks on the circuit board. I can fix it if you have spare parts."
Tutorial_300056,Done! Now the entrance is back to normal. Your basic security has been restored.
Tutorial_300057,"Thank god! Now the next thing we need to do is to find the Overseer and the Resource Purifier.. Whatever his agenda is, we have to get him back!"
Tutorial_300058,Let us help you. We are all in this together.
Tutorial_300059,"(He seems trustworthy. And, look at his size, compared with the other Vault Dwellers... I think we should trust him)"
Tutorial_300060,"Hey Ma'am, you have a good eye! I'm not only an engineer, but I'm also a seasoned fighter! I'd be happy to join you."
Tutorial_300061,"We don't have enough space in our living quarters, so we can't take in any new Dwellers. <playername>, you know how to build one, these things are your responsibility now."
Tutorial_300062,"See? I stand in the <color=#2b669d>front row in the battle, and deal physical damage</color> to the enemies! Isn't that impressive!"
Tutorial_300063,Let's look at my combat skills......
Tutorial_300064,Now my <color=#2b669d>Perk</color>. I have <color=#2b669d>Combat Perk</color> which helped me deal with countless enemies in battle!
Tutorial_300065,Impressed yet? Yes? Alright! So what do you want me to do next?
Tutorial_300066,Enter the Vault. The entrance is where the Vault's Combat Team assembles. I need to look at the map and plan our route for searching the Ex-Overseer...
Tutorial_300067,A map? When was it made? It might not be up to date or accurate...
Tutorial_300068,"Before we discovered your Vault, we noticed there is only one hidden path that connects from here to Sanctuary Hills, which is not far away."
Tutorial_300069,"In other words, your Ex-Overseer will surely have passed Sanctuary Hills. We can set off immediately and search for his whereabouts in that vicinity."
Tutorial_300070,"Sturges, looks like the Vault Door is back to normal."
Tutorial_300071,"Preston! You came back at a good time. The Dwellers of this Vault are eager to find their Overseer, whom seemingly has abandoned them."
Tutorial_300072,"You are right, there are no other paths around here except the one that leads to Sanctuary Hills. If you decide to go out, I'll go with you. However..."
Tutorial_300073,"The environment is still nasty out there in the Wasteland. When you're traveling, you must use <color=#2b669d>Rad-X</color> regularly... or the radiation will slowly turn you into monsters."
Tutorial_300074,This seems to be a fitting adventure to test your limits as our new Overseer. Don't let your people down!
Tutorial_300075,"Don't worry, the Minutemen have plenty Rad-X to cover this operation. Troops, ROLL OUT!"
Tutorial_300076,"Be careful, we are in <color=#2b669d>unexplored territory.</color> Don't act rashly before selecting a <color=#2b669d>visible room</color>. Let's enter the room next to ours."
Tutorial_300077,"Got it? We can always see clearly what is happening in the neighboring rooms. <color=#2b669d>Observe the rooms nearby and decide the next step</color>, that is how we explore a new environment."
Tutorial_300078,Tap the staircase and we will know the nature of the rooms that lay ahead. Then tap the floor you wish to go to.
Tutorial_300079,"Watch out! Some mutant creatures are blocking our way, but they're only a few runts, we can take them... CHARGE!!!"
Tutorial_300080,"Our AP rises as the battle progresses. <color=#2b669d>When our AP is full, it's time to use our Special Abilities</color>!"
Tutorial_300081,Accumulate AP in combat and release the abilities at the right timing... This is the trick of winning the fight!
Tutorial_300082,"You're finally back. Have you found the Overseer? Also, who is this woman who showed up at our door? Did you tell her to come here?"
Tutorial_300083,"Yes, ma'am, and no we didn't find your Overseer over at Sanctuary Hills. We did find her, though. I think given the status quo, your Vault can use some additional manpower... or... womanpower ha ha"
Tutorial_300084,Humph! You did that without my approval...
Tutorial_300085,"<playername>, do you know how to expand the Living Quarters? We must increase living quarter sizes to accommodate more Dwellers."
Tutorial_300086,"Thank you so much, for taking me in! Trust me, I'm a very good healer, I will do my best to be useful!"
Tutorial_300087,"You're a healer? That's great! ...if the Minutemen had had a medic, our journey could have been... Well, I don't want to talk about it."
Tutorial_300088,"Anyway, with a healer by our side, our chance of survival out there is much higher! Aren't you guys lucky to have me!?"
Tutorial_300089,"I wouldn't call us lucky to have you, Sturges... What I mean to say is... we now have a pretty good number of Dwellers. New Overseer, you need to learn some basic personnel management."
Tutorial_300090,"This list can tell you how many Dwellers are in the Vault, how well-trained they are, and the job they are doing... See, pretty straight-forward."
Tutorial_300091,THAT IS THE CUTEST DOG EVER!
Tutorial_300092,"And I see you also brought back some loot... A great haul, rookie!"
Tutorial_300093,"There is usually some good stuff in <color=#2b669d>Lunchboxes</color> like this. Try not to miss any of them, okay?"
Tutorial_300094,We have searched twice and still no sign of the Overseer... Where could he possibly have gone...
Tutorial_300095,"I think we should build a <color=#2b669d>Radio Studio</color> so that we can contact the Minutemen through the radio, which makes it easier to send our messages to them and theirs to us."
Tutorial_300096,"Plus, we can <color=#2b669d>monitor communications across the Wasteland with the radio, a great way for us to receive information from the outside</color>. Perhaps we can even find your Overseer."
Tutorial_300097,Let's get to building!
Tutorial_300098,Great! Let's attune the frequency and magnify the signal receiver... Done! Here comes signal! Now let me try to reach the Minutemen's transceiver...
Tutorial_300099,Hello? Calling the Minutemen! Can you hear me?
Tutorial_300100,Preston needs our help. I have to head out right away!
Tutorial_300101,We aren't ungrateful folks. Let's do this together! There are some things I want to make clear before we get started.
Tutorial_300102,"Our signal receiver can cover the West Concord area, which means we can learn some basic information about West Concord from the Radio Studio."
Tutorial_300103,"See, this is where the radio wave signal came from, the Museum of Freedom! With the exact location coordinates, we will be able to head straight there and not waste any time."
Tutorial_300104,It's good timing that you came back... We just received a new signal while you were out.
Tutorial_300105,"From the wave frequency analysis of the signal source, they should be using the same <color=#2b669d>Vault-Tec Radio System</color> as ours."
Tutorial_300106,Looks like we are not alone on this Wasteland. Let's see who these <color=#2b669d>new friends</color> are...
Tutorial_300107,"Since we are both from Vault communities, I think we might be able to form a close bond with each other and even something stronger, an <color=#2b669d>alliance</color>..."
Tutorial_300108,Well... that's an impressive load of supplies you've got! There are so many materials that you can build weapons with!
Tutorial_300109,"What are you waiting for!? With these materials, you can <color=#2b669d>enhance</color> your weapon right away! Let me teach you how..."
Tutorial_300110,"I just activated the <color=#2b669d>Quest System</color>. All of your tutorials so far have been recorded in it. You ought to get familiar with it now, because it will be useful in the future."
Tutorial_300111,See? I have arranged all the Quests you need to handle. You better follow them.
Tutorial_300112,Look at this! This is <color=#2b669d>Combat Equipment</color>! Yeah! These things you can use during a fight. Invest as many resources as you can in these babies!
Tutorial_300113,Come on! Let's start enhancing! Hey!
Tutorial_300114,"See! <color=#2b669d>Our Power has been improved with this enhancement!</color> Ah, I love this feeling!"
Tutorial_300115,"We can't find the Overseer or the Resource Purifier......If we want to continue living here, then we need a better system."
Tutorial_300116,Remember the <color=#2b669d>Enhanced Tools</color> I mentioned earlier? Now we've come to the stage where we must enhance our production tools to improve Dwellers work efficiency.
Tutorial_300117,Let's get started! The Vault must be maintained! Until we find the Resource Purifier.... or find another solution...
Tutorial_300118,Incoming transmission signal in the Radio Studio! It's from Preston! Put it through!
Tutorial_300119,"Sounds like good news. Now Preston and his Minutemen have finally settled down. Remember when we first saw them, they were like Wasteland refugees..."
Tutorial_300120,"When you are ready, let's go to the <color=#2b669d>Minutemen Camp</color>."
Tutorial_300121,Now we can get some supplies every day. Make good use of this stuff.
Tutorial_300122,"Welcome to the Minutemen Camp. Although we only have the simplest essentials so far, trust me, the Minutemen will be reborn here. I have a plan."
Tutorial_300123,"In fact, my plan is rather simple - do what we can to help the settlers that need us and earn their support, then we try to recruit them to the Minutemen."
Tutorial_300124,"So, we set up a Request Terminal for the settlers to enter their problems and needs and we solve them."
Tutorial_300125,"As for your Vault, you can also access the Request Terminal to help the settlers out. I believe you will find this a rewarding experience."
Tutorial_300126,"Right, your Vault just began to get involved with the Wasteland's business. You can really use some veterans."
Tutorial_300127,"Now we Minutemen have basically settled down, you can ask Ronnie Shaw to assist you. You will find her very helpful."
Tutorial_300128,I hope we can keep a long-term partnership. This will be beneficial to both of us in the future.
Tutorial_300129,"All right, now we are safe. Let's talk about <color=#2b669d>Combat Attachments</color>..."
Tutorial_300130,"Here, put it on. Remember that every member can wear up to four Combat Attachment pieces. If these items belong to the set, they grants bonus attributes. Keep your eyes peeled when you collect them."
Tutorial_300131,And the effect of each Attachment differs with its level and quality. You will need to pick and match them carefully.
Tutorial_300132,Now you're all geared up and ready to go! Try to discover and collect better Attachments in the future.
Tutorial_300133,We have defeated this group of Raiders. Mama Murphy wants to express her gratitude to you.
Tutorial_300134,"Greetings, friends from the Vault. Although I have been keeping an eye on you, I think this is the first time we've officially met."
Tutorial_300135,"Oh, I see.. you are searching for a man... yes, yes, it is truly difficult for you to find him now..."
Tutorial_300136,I saw you... in the Combat Zone... winning applause and fame... Go. You will get the information you want...
Tutorial_300137,The Minutemen Camp is at the Museum of Freedom. Let's set off!
Tutorial_300138,"Here we are. Look, Preston is waiting for us over there."
Tutorial_300139,"All right, all right, you are the Overseer and you have a plan. You can arrange things as you like..."
Tutorial_300140,"After switching the positions, you can save your scheme through the Vault's Central Intelligence System so your layout is completed."
Tutorial_300141,"Good news, the <color=#2b669d>Research Room</color> is ready! Now we can develop <color=#2b669d>Research Projects</color>. Let's take a look..."
Tutorial_300142,Each Incident should be <color=#2b669d>100% explored</color> so we can send Mr. Handy to <color=#2b669d>execute exploration Quests and help us gather resources</color>.
Tutorial_300143,"This is a <color=#2b669d>Perk Training Room.</color> Send our Dwellers to receive some Perk Training. Whether it is for production or combat, improving their perks will always prove useful!"
Tutorial_300144,Exploring a lair is tricky business. Take a look at this...
Tutorial_300145,Who doesn't like a lovely little thing like this? Let's put it in a production room to cheer the workers up and improve efficiency!
Tutorial_300146,The Memory Den! This is some advanced technology! We can get fragments of memories through Memory Simulations. And there is a place where we can trade good stuff for memory frags..
Tutorial_300147,"There are many ruins in the Wasteland that are left behind with resources, we can use this Radar Room to spot these ruins and salvage the resources."
Tutorial_300148,See! An unoccupied ruin has been detected! Capture it so the resources will be ours!
Tutorial_300149,"Mind you, we can also detect ruins that are occupied. You'll have to send a Combat Team to capture it, if you want the resources."
Tutorial_300150,Great! Now we can produce our own Attachments. I don't think I need to explain them again.
Tutorial_300151,Yo! Furry little animals are the most adorable creatures. Taking care of them makes me so happy...
Tutorial_300152,See? Each Incident has exploration requirements. We gain exploration progress once our Combat Team finishes a requirement.
Tutorial_300153,"Once we reach a certain exploration percentage, we can activate a Mr. Handy to automatically explore the area for us."
Tutorial_300154,"As you can see, we can research <color=#2b669d>Building Tech to improve the Vault's efficiency</color> and <color=#2b669d>Combat Tech for the battles</color>. First, the Building..."
Tutorial_300155,"See, these technologies can make our Vault run more stable and increase resource production."
Tutorial_300156,Now let's look at the Combat Techs.
Tutorial_300157,"In the Research Room, we can do research on profession specialization, and help the Combat Team enhance their combat skills in many ways, I believe you know its value. So, let's see what projects there are."
Tutorial_300158,Do you see? The Perks tab shows each Dweller's specialty.
Tutorial_300159,Now you can choose a Dweller that is suitable to work in the Power Generator.
Tutorial_300160,Check this! This is our <color=#2b669d>Equipment</color>!
Tutorial_300161,"Mind you, <color=#2b669d>Tools have different effects</color>. Don't make mistakes when you try to upgrade them."
Tutorial_300162,Looks like you are ready. Let's go to the Minutemen Camp.
Tutorial_300163,"After we received transmission from other Vaults, we learn more and more information from them. Some can prove crucial to us."
Tutorial_300164,"It is said that the Vaults across the Wasteland usually sign treaties with one another to form an <color=#2b669d>Alliance</color>. Members of the same alliance help each other, or otherwise..."
Tutorial_300165,"If you don't belong to any alliance, we may face competitive pressure in various aspects. So this is a very realistic decision for us -"
Tutorial_300166,"<color=#2b669d> To join an alliance, or create one of our own</color>."
Tutorial_300167,You can check here for more details. I am leaving the option to you.
Tutorial_300168,Our radio has received some strong interference from Concord!
Tutorial_300169,The signal seems to come from somewhere underground. It seems to suggest there is a vast empty space underground with intense biological activity.
Tutorial_300170,"Based on the information we have, it is very dangerous to explore this location. We must arm our squad with the best equipment we can."
Tutorial_300171,"But the good news is, we have fixed a Mr. Handy specialized in resource retrieval, which can be used for gathering resources from large caverns."
Tutorial_300172,"Once you've cleared all threats from the region, you can send Mr. Handy in to retrieve resources."
Tutorial_300173,"You can select the level of search here. The deeper you want to explore, the longer it takes and the better rewards you will get."
Tutorial_300174,"Then I will proceed with the resource search protocol based on the data of this location. Here, for example... However, you need to provide a certain amount of Rad-X as my fuel."
Tutorial_300175,You can also manage my work here.
Tutorial_300176,"As a search robot, I can not only search for supplies, but also life signals."
Tutorial_300177,"Last time I was searching in Super Duper Mart, I detected a life signal. Perhaps you can check there?"
Tutorial_300178,Wow! What a lovely kitten!
Tutorial_300179,"The next time you come across a little cutie like this, remember to assign it to a production room."
Tutorial_300180,"Don't worry, I trust you will find the Overseer. Next, follow me to the Minutemen base. I want to show you something."
Tutorial_300181,Remember I said that we would do our best to help the settlers that needed it? Now they are starting to have faith in us.
Tutorial_300182,"So, we set up a Request Terminal for the settlers to enter their problems. And we solve them."
Tutorial_300183,"Helping the settlers complete their requests is essential to your Vault as well. Come, let's take a look."
Tutorial_300184,"We post 1 faction Quest here, everyday. Hope you can help us complete these Quests, and you can also gain reputation points."
Tutorial_300185,Terrible......maybe we are too late and the Ex-Overseer has already left the Sunshine Tidings Co-Op.
Tutorial_300186,"Maybe Tommy's intel was unreliable! Oh, shoot! Where on earth could the Ex-Overseer be!?"
Tutorial_300187,"If you don't know what to do next, just check the Quest List."
Tutorial_300188,"See, the Dwellers are so happy that their work efficiency improves."
Tutorial_300189,"Good news. We have unlocked the <color=#2b669d>daily sign-in system</color>, where we can claim general supplies. Don't forget to check it out every day."
Tutorial_300190,Have you noticed it yet? You have collected a certain number of <color=#2b669d>Dweller's Posters</color>. You can recruit this Dweller now!
Tutorial_300191,"Look, our system has recorded information of famous people across the Wasteland. If you collect enough Posters, we can invite them to our Vault."
Tutorial_300192,"Besides, as our Vault expands, you need to arrange the structures more reasonably to improve its efficiency."
Tutorial_300193,Now you can open <color=#2b669d>Reorganize</color> function to change the Vault's layout.
Tutorial_300194,"Okay, just give out your instructions from here and let Allie go to the door where she will stand by."
Tutorial_300195,The Radio Studio of the Vault is completed. Let's return home.
Tutorial_300196,"To use the Radio Studio, we need to open signal reception first."
Tutorial_300197,The Radio Studio has received an important transmission. Let's go back to see.
Tutorial_300198,"Okay, the data is yours. You can open the Daily Quest page for more details."
Tutorial_300199,We have categorized the Attachments into a few different groups. Different modules produce different Attachment stats.
Tutorial_300200,We need to verify the quality of the Attachments being crafted here.
Tutorial_300201,"Keep in mind, Dwellers assigned at this location will be dispatched from the Vault. They will have to successfully defend against enemy Raiders to bring the resources back to the Vault."
Tutorial_300202,Yo! Furry little animals are the most adorable creatures. Taking care of them makes me so happy...
Tutorial_300203,"First, you need to select the quality of the pet you wish to adopt."
Tutorial_300204,Then we will calculate the amount of pet Food that it will consume.
Tutorial_300205,Now let me introduce the information panel and functions of the production rooms to you.
Tutorial_300206,Output means the amount of resources the room can provide per hour.
Tutorial_300207,"Capacity means the amount of collectible resources that the room can hold, i.e. the max reserve volume."
Tutorial_300208,This displays the number of available job vacancies and the active workers in this room.
Tutorial_300209,You can tap here to view the contents we just mentioned.
Tutorial_300210,"Remember, we must provide the Dwellers with sufficient housing to support their basic needs."
Tutorial_300211,Here you can view the current number of Dwellers and max population of the Vault.
Tutorial_300212,"If you want to expand our living capacity, you have to upgrade or build more living quarters."
Tutorial_300213,"First, the radio messages we receive from the Wasteland will be archived under the Radio category."
Tutorial_300214,"Second, messages from other Vaults will be under the Wasteland Tab"
Tutorial_300215,"Lastly, video holotapes that we collected will be under the Video category. That's about it."
Tutorial_300216,The Archive is used for storing all sorts of documents.
Tutorial_300217,All the information here will be saved permanently. We can view them anytime we need to.
Tutorial_300218,The Attachment Workshop is where we manage all the Attachments and crafting materials.
Tutorial_300219,You can issue dismantle orders of Attachments from here.
Tutorial_300220,"To do that, simply select the attachment you want to dismantle and tap Confirm. Meanwhile, the materials dismantled will be recycled and stored in the inventory."
Tutorial_300221,The Pet Center manages all pets and pet Foods in the Vault.
Tutorial_300222,You can release pets from here.
Tutorial_300223,"Select the pet you wish to release and tap Confirm to do that. Meanwhile, the Foods of the released pet will be recycled and stored in the inventory."
Tutorial_300224,<color=#2b669d>The level of the Overseer's Office decides those of other Vault structures</color>.
Tutorial_300225,"To <color=#2b669d>upgrade the Overseer's Office</color>, you need to meet the <color=#2b669d>Vault Level</color> requirement."
Tutorial_300226,"Ah, it's so amazing to see the daylight again!"
Tutorial_300227,"As we explore deeper into the Wasteland, we will discover more channels to gain resources."
Tutorial_300228,"Your Daily Quests are listed in here. And remember, the Quest List will be updated at 6 o'clock everyday."
Tutorial_300229,"Once you complete one of these Quests, you gain <color=#2b669d>BP Points</color>."
Tutorial_300230,"When your BP Points reaches a certain level, you will get <color=#2b669d>Daily Bonuses</color>. Don't forget to check your completion progress and claim the rewards."
Tutorial_300231,We received a transmission. You can read the transcript in the radio room
Tutorial_300232,Are you sure you want to skip this transmission?
Tutorial_300233,This is the summary of Vault information.
Tutorial_300234,<color=#2b669d>EXP gained from building structures</color> is the only way to help us improve the Vault's <color=#2b669d>Level</color>.
Tutorial_300235,"As the Vault's Level increases, more functional structures will be unlocked."
Tutorial_300236,Our resource collection rate is a little too slow. We can do it more efficiently. Let me show you.
Tutorial_300237,"Once you have <color=#2b669d>cleared</color> an Incident, you can <color=#2b669d>consume Nuka-Cherry</color> to <color=#2b669d>Sweep</color> the Incident again, later."
Tutorial_300238,"With that, we can spend more time searching for the Ex-Overseer, rather than being caught in the endless cycle of passing Incidents to collect resources."
Tutorial_300239,"I knew this day would come, the number of dwellers has reached its capacity......looks like it's time to use the cryogenic chamber"
Tutorial_300240,"We can freeze idle dwellers temporarily, this would give the Vault more living spaces."
Tutorial_300241,Tap the Freeze button under a Dweller card to put the Dweller into cryogenic stasis.
Tutorial_300242,"For <color=#2b669d> every Dweller you freeze</color>, your Vault <color=#2b669d>population is reduced accordingly</color>."
Tutorial_300243,"Of course, you can reawaken a frozen Dweller at any time."
Tutorial_300244,"On the premise of sufficient accommodations in the Vault, of course."
Tutorial_300245,"Naturally, if you want to create high quality items, you have to provide better materials."
Tutorial_300246,"While exploring the Wasteland, if a dweller takes in a certain amount of radiation, it takes a long time for the damage to heal naturally."
Tutorial_300247,"However, when we have a Medical Bay, this problem will be largely solved."
Tutorial_300248,"Warning! Our dweller has suffered from radiation during the exploration, which takes a long time to recover."
Tutorial_300249,"Welcome to the guild camp! As you can see the guild has already built some basic facilities, but this is just the beginning."
Tutorial_300250,"Just like managing our Vault, building or upgrading new guild structures can unlock more guild functions."
Tutorial_300251,"Note that the guild has both internal and external constructions. They are very beneficial for the development of the guild, and also requires resources to build."
Tutorial_300252,Remember that guild constructions require help from all guild members. Cooperation is the key to advancement.
Tutorial_300253,"Now, you must want to know how to expand the guild, right? First, learn how to upgrade the basic facilities of the guild."
Tutorial_300254,"To build or upgrade a guild facility, you need to collect resources from guild members."
Tutorial_300255,"When resource collection reaches 100%, the guild can summon the construction team and begin building the guild facility."
Tutorial_300256,"Of course, as a reward, guild members will receive Honor Points for each donation."
Tutorial_300257,"After joining a guild, you will notice that the guild will issue a set number of co-op Quests everyday."
Tutorial_300258,"When you decide to do the Quest, you need to select ""invite co-op"" to send a Quest invitation to a guild member. You can activate and begin the Quest only when the guild member accepts the invitation."
Tutorial_300259,Note that Co-op Quests require both parties to complete their own objectives within the time limit in order to complete the Quest and receive rewards.
Tutorial_300260,"Don't know if you've noticed, our combat squad has had a little change. It's quite interesting, come have a look."
Tutorial_300261,"This Dweller just activated <color=#2b669d>'Bond'</color> effect! When <color=#2b669d>two or more members in the squad have a 'bond' connection</color>, they will improve the effects."
Tutorial_300262,"If you want to know more about 'bonds', you can look for more information on the dweller's details interface."
Tutorial_300263,"First, let's check out the guild's basic functions"
Tutorial_300264,Guild Hall has all the basic information of the guild.
Tutorial_300265,"Meanwhile, player can start activities like ""Guild Assistance"" and ""Lease Dwellers"" from here"
Tutorial_300266,"Now, let's see how to send your Dweller out as a mercenary"
Tutorial_300267,"Select a Dweller you want to send from the Dwellers List. After this Dweller finishes helping other players in combat, you will receive Honor Points as reward."
Tutorial_300268,"Attention, you are now entering a Rescue Ops Incident, which costs your passport obtained through small Incidents."
Tutorial_300269,You can check your Honor Points and reward for the current Incident in Damage Rank.
Tutorial_300270,You can check each guild's total damage ranking and their rewards in Guild Rank.
Tutorial_300271,"Now, work with your partners and let's put down more monster bosses!"
Tutorial_300272,"Great, now let's look at how to build <color=#2b669d>a second power generator</color> to increase the Vault's power supply."
Tutorial_300273,"<color=#2b669d>Rooms of the same type and level will automatically connect themselves, </color>this helps us with managing the Vault."
Tutorial_300274,"Now our Vault has some basic power supplies, but you should know that there are <color=#2b669d>mutant critter lairs</color> scattered around. They can hinder the development of our Vault."
Tutorial_300275,"Look, these <color=#2b669d>mutant critter lairs</color> are right next to the Vault's inner passages. If you don't want to be their neighbor, then we must clear them out."
Tutorial_300276,"If we want to attack the enemies, then we need to deploy a <color=#2b669d>combat squad</color> at the Vault door, because only <color=#2b669d>combat squads</color> are allowed to participate in battle."
Tutorial_300277,"Putting together a combat squad is not easy, we need to carefully <color=#2b669d>select the best fighters for this</color>"
Tutorial_300278,You can check a dweller's combat properties in the <color=#2b669d>dweller details interface</color>.
Tutorial_300279,"Everything on this interface is an important reference for picking combat members, we should choose the members accordingly."
Tutorial_300280,"After looking at the combat information, I trust that you have a basic understanding of how to begin the allocation. So now let's start clearing out nearby mutant critter lairs."
Tutorial_300281,"I have to say, that was quite a thrilling fight. Good thing I was here to prepare you! Now, let me tell you <color=#2b669d>how to train combat members to increase their combat abilities</color>. This will help you better prepare for bigger challenges"
Tutorial_300282,"Before we start training, I will be making a list of <color=#2b669d>Quests</color> for you to do. This list will help you complete the training in a more orderly fashion. Okay, time to activate the <color=#2b669d>Quest System</color>."
Tutorial_300283,"Your mission is to build a <color=#2b669d>training room</color>, we can <color=#2b669d>train our Dwellers </color>into stronger, better fighters."
Tutorial_300284,"The Diner is ready. We need to move a decent cook to work there. Before that, you will need to learn some better tools to help you manage- an easier and <color=#2b669d>more effective management method</color>."
Tutorial_300285,"Command a Dweller with <color=#2b669d>chef production abilities</color> to the <color=#2b669d>Diner</color>, and <color=#2b669d>speed up </color>the process once."
Tutorial_300286,Come on. it's time to see how the training pays off! Let's start <color=#2b669d>clearing the next monster nest.</color>
Tutorial_300287,"The Diner is now running smoothly, but don't get complacent, your Dwellers are always hungry!"
Tutorial_300288,"So, <color=#2b669d>select the Diner and speed up the process</color>! You will learn the importance of having a sufficient supply of food soon enough."
Tutorial_300289,"Ok, there is enough food, now let's <color=#2b669d>continue training </color>Dwellers."
Tutorial_300290,"When we have enough in our Food Supplies, we can choose to <color=#2b669d>train multiple levels</color> at once!"
Tutorial_300291,"Brilliant, I can feel it, Sia is stronger than before. Let's <color=#2b669d>assign her to the Vault entrance. </color>"
Tutorial_300292,"Looks like she does have some fighting experience, this might be of some help for future explorations."
Tutorial_300293,"Well, I still think she needs to practice in the training room, I don't want anyone to slow us down."
Tutorial_300294,"<playername>, I don't need to say any more about training, right? That's up to you now."
Tutorial_300295,"You should know, every Dweller can wear 4 Combat Attachments, if these 4 Attachments happen to be from the same set, then it will add extra combat perks."
Tutorial_300296,"Can you see the sets menu up above? You can check all of the attachment's information here, and additional combat properties of sets."
Tutorial_300297,We can also see which Attachments are already owned by clicking the sets bar. Convenient huh?
Tutorial_300298,"And of course, we can also click on the complete set, and see all the Attachments that we own."
Tutorial_300299,You will learn better by doing. Let's put on an Attachment and see.
Tutorial_300300,The second power generator is ready. Do you remember what we should do next? Allocate a Dweller to work there!
Tutorial_300301,"Remember! Combat Levels determine a Dweller's combat abilities. Raising the combat levels, will effectively raise their combat abilities."
Tutorial_300302,Now let's look at the other combat properties
Tutorial_300303,Don't give up. We couldn't find whom you were looking for but we rescued someone from the Raiders. It wasn't all for nothing.
Tutorial_300304,"If she didn't go down the wrong road, she should be at the Vault's entrance by now, let's go back to the Vault to check."
Tutorial_300305,"This guy really does look like a merchant, maybe he really will contact us when we get back to the Vault."
Tutorial_300306,"Anyway, let's go back first."
Tutorial_300307,"You must remember, you both have different tasks, this is your friend's mission."
Tutorial_300308,And this is the mission you need to complete. Don't get mixed up.
Tutorial_300309,"Look! I just received a message, looks like it's from an unknown friend from the Wasteland, he gave us a contact for a Wasteland trader. Let's listen to it......"
Tutorial_300310,"In the trading market, Nuka-Cola and Pre-War Money can be used as currency, but only some goods can be paid for with Nuka-Cola. Others can only be paid for with Pre-War Money."
Tutorial_300311,"If we have enough Nuka-Cola, we can exchange them for Pre-War Money, and then use this to buy goods."
Tutorial_300312,"To purchase dweller posters, you should go to Super Duper Mart. Can't wait, huh? Now let's go shopping!"
Tutorial_300313,"You can only get a large amount of Posters from the Super Duper Mart. There's enough Posters for us to recruit new Dwellers for the Vault, do you want to try? Come on..."
Tutorial_300314,"Good, now that you're back, the Vault received some new messages, let's take a look."
Tutorial_300315,You can check a dweller's combat properties in the <color=#2b669d>dweller details interface</color>.
Tutorial_300316,"We found a cute cat, it looks a bit weak, we should bring it back to the Vault as soon as possible. I trust the Vault Dwellers will like it."
Tutorial_300317,"Our exploration of the Wasteland has been successful so far, but we have some more people needing help. We better check the messages from our Radio Studio."
Tutorial_300318,There are more dangerous and more frightening enemies in the Wasteland. We can classify danger categories through data analysis.
Tutorial_300319,"We can use new map levels to mark these dangers, if we were to confront them, we need to make sure our combat squad has enough power."
Tutorial_300320,"Ok, these Pre-War Money should be enough for us to buy something from the Super Duper Mart, let's go check it out."
Tutorial_300321,"Before trading, remember to read the item's description carefully so we don't buy an incorrect item."
Tutorial_300322,There aren't any refund services in the Wasteland
Tutorial_300323,Let's see what we need to look out for when completing one of these Quests.
Tutorial_300324,"To begin with, if the dweller you sent out has successfully completed their task, you can receive additional reputation rewards."
Tutorial_300325,And you can look at the enemy's detail interface to find a way to best go against their abilities.
Tutorial_300326,"For additional information, the counter relationship between different races and teams will also be effective in combat zone battles."
Tutorial_300327,"The Cloakroom contains owned Skins and costumes, you can also buy more costumes."
Tutorial_300328,"After selecting a Dweller, you can see costumes that are available for them, you can see how it looks on them by clicking the clothes."
Tutorial_300329,"Hi! We just received a message from Diamond City, it seems they need our help with something complicated, let's go check it out."
Tutorial_300330,"Hmm, this is what the transmitter indicated as an assistance mission with high level of danger. There are different types of missions that are only available on certain days."
Tutorial_300331,"Before we take on an assistance mission, we should read the mission description very carefully and look at the enemy's information. Some enemies are immune to certain attacks, it could be a very difficult fight."
Tutorial_300332,"Attention! Resources needed for training are insufficient, if we want to finish this training, we need to use some 'special' methods."
Tutorial_300333,"We can use some Nuka-Cola to make up for the resources, this will ensure the completion of training."
Tutorial_300334,"We have been searching for information in every corner of the Wasteland, according to recent intel, the radio studio drew a new map, it has even more dangerous enemies marked on there."
Tutorial_300335,"These enemies are very dangerous, if the combat squad is not strong enough, then you shouldn't try your luck."
Tutorial_300336,"The radio studio has drawn another map, the enemies marked this time are probably the most dangerous of all in the Wasteland"
Tutorial_300337,Should we let our combat squad face these dangers?
Tutorial_300338,"Big events will take place once in a while exploring the Wasteland, participating and completing these big events is very beneficial to the Vault and the collection of resources."
Tutorial_300339,"When you see that this button is usable, this means a big event is happening, you should check it out."
Tutorial_300340,"In the assistance production interface, we can send dwellers to a guild member's Vault, and help them with producing resources."
Tutorial_300341,Members of the guild can send and receive help 3 times a day
Tutorial_300342,"You have entered the Guild Rescue Mission, we have locked on a bunch of extremely dangerous enemies which need to be eliminated."
Tutorial_300343,The Command Center has made a list of Quests according to the enemy's danger level.
Tutorial_300344,"Once the Quest has concluded, we will rank you according to your overall damage, and give out contribution rewards. We hope you will be an active member, and we are looking forward to seeing you!"
Tutorial_300345,"To assist in this elimination task, you have been granted access to our Guild's reinforcements."
Tutorial_300346,Here you can make the Guild's reinforcements a part of the combat squad.
Tutorial_300347,"Hello, anyone?"
Tutorial_300348,(Yawn) We hear you. What's up?
Tutorial_300349,(Whisper) Care for a ...treasure hunt?
Tutorial_300350,...Please go ahead.
Tutorial_300351,(Whisper) Take care of this map... It was hard for me to get it...
Tutorial_300352,"As you see, I marked different zones on it, each controlled by a faction."
Tutorial_300353,But I believe a veteran like you would have no trouble dealing with them.
Tutorial_300354,"Ah, just in case... Each zone is better to be explored with certain suitable dwellers. So please arrange your team properly."
Tutorial_300355,But what's the treasure you're talking about anyway?
Tutorial_300356,It's...some Sugarbombs with special flavors which can only be found in these areas of Commonwealth...
Tutorial_300357,What?? What do we need these Sugarbombs for?
Tutorial_300358,"Easy, look here."
Tutorial_300359,"If you could find enough sugarbombs, I have some...items gained from special channels that you can redeem them for."
Tutorial_300360,Your items look interesting... Eh... What is this?
Tutorial_300361,It's new tech from the En...influential dwellers that can boost your attachments. Does it strike you?
Tutorial_300362,Sounds pretty good! Guess it's time to fetch some Sugarbombs!
Tutorial_300363,"Seems you've got some sugarbombs, and some Encla...uh...new tech..."
Tutorial_300364,How on earth do these things work?
Tutorial_300365,Heehee... These Adaptability Chips can permanently modify your attachments and increase the attributes.
Tutorial_300366,"Hold on, you're telling me, this chip can modify my hat and pants?"
Tutorial_300367,"Of course, and if you decide you don't like the results, you can reset the modified effects."
Tutorial_300368,"But it does have a price. You will lose the adaptability chips you spent before... But, you can get some kits back in return..."
Tutorial_300369,This is not science at all!
Tutorial_300370,Looks you've located a treasure spot... You can assign a dweller to be stationed here for some time to see what he could find.
Tutorial_300371,More Sugarbombs?
Tutorial_300372,"Um, that's a high possibility. But remember, the Dweller's abilities affect how much treasure they find. You can find more treasure by increasing their stats."
Tutorial_300373,Some treasure spots are available for more than one explorer. That seems like a no-brainer. More explorers means more profit!
Tutorial_300374,"Overseer, our radio station received a strange signal that sounds fishy. We think you might be interested."
Tutorial_300375,The night falls and evils start to spread in the shadows. But true dwellers never fear the dark. It's time to press the attack!
Tutorial_300376,"Tonight, our dwellers have come to Hubris Comics, a place quiet and eerie. Are they stepping right in to the trap laid by their enemies?"
Tutorial_300377,"It sounds this guy is inviting you to Hubris Comics. I guess this is trap. But I'm more certain that you would ignore my warning. Get ready and move, ""dwellers!"""
Tutorial_300378,The night falls and evils start to spread in the shadows. But true dwellers never fear the dark. It's time to press the attack!
Tutorial_300379,Of course our dwellers are prepared. First they've arranged enough supplies from the Hubris Souvenir Shop...
Tutorial_300380,"Meanwhile, Boston's people appear to have many quests for our dwellers that grant some special rewards upon completion."
Tutorial_300381,Um...it looks sinister here. See these comic books? This is where our adventure starts. Now tap comic dwellers - Invincible Alliance...
Tutorial_300382,Hubris is renowned for their comics. We must use Hubris Reading Coupons before starting the adventure.
Tutorial_300383,"Here, I've found some left behind by the former Overseer. Make good use of them since they're rare to find."
Tutorial_300384,Now let's begin to explore Hubris!
Tutorial_300385,"Look, we've unlocked a new comic chapter after finishing this comic book. Don't forget to come back here to see if you're able to start new adventures every time you complete one in Hubris."
Tutorial_300386,Now let's enter the comic world of the Silver Shroud.
Tutorial_300387,"You can select scenarios of three types in each comic dweller's own story: Story, Free and Challenge."
Tutorial_300388,Free stories that can be completed repeatedly grant enormous tokens as reward.
Tutorial_300389,Specified combat rules are applied to a comic dweller's exclusive adventure. Please check it out.
Tutorial_300390,"Help! We're under attack!...Eh, bloody Gunners...(Gunshots)"
Tutorial_300391,"This is the fourth today sending an SOS. The first three ""caravans"" were either pranks or disguised by bandits. Why should we believe you?"
Tutorial_300392,"(Gunshots)...Cough, damn it! Have you never heard Crimson Caravan?"
Tutorial_300393,What? The Crimson Caravan... Then you must have many good stuff.
Tutorial_300394,"Pooh! Snobbery!... Well, guess we have no choice..."
Tutorial_300395,"Listen, our caravan were separated by the Gunners. Now they're scattered in several areas."
Tutorial_300396,"If you can save them, I promise you'll be well rewarded. You know our reputation. Our goods will definitely blow your mind."
Tutorial_300397,Deal! Leave it to us!
Tutorial_300398,"Thank goodness! Perfect timing. A few minutes longer, we'll be dead meat..."
Tutorial_300399,You're welcome. Heard you have a lot of good stuff. Care to show us?
Tutorial_300400,"Of course. Although the Gunners snatched some, we still have some rare goods left for your selection..."
Tutorial_300401,"Help! The Gunners again! Please, we've got nothing left!"
Tutorial_300402,"Easy, friend, we're not the Gunners."
Tutorial_300403,"But...you got super mutants, synths and ghouls... What the hell are you? It feels you're more terrifying than the Gunners..."
Tutorial_300404,"Calm down, we're here to buy something..."
Tutorial_300405,"(Shrug) Do it quickly, we really have nothing left but our lives!"
Tutorial_300406,We're not robbers! We're here to help.
Tutorial_300407,(Squint) Really?
Tutorial_300408,Yes!
Tutorial_300409,"(Relief) Alright, seems you're honest. Check my wares! They're the finest in the land!"
Tutorial_300410,We've saved another caravan! Looks we got more pretty stuff to buy.
Tutorial_300411,What are you talking about? We're just a bunch of scavengers in rags.
Tutorial_300412,(Wink) Don't play dumb. You Crimson Caravan got many good stuff!
Tutorial_300413,"Sigh, very well... At least you're paying..."
Tutorial_300414,Seems that's all the scattered caravans... Quite a job.
Tutorial_300415,Wha...what? Are...are we safe?
Tutorial_300416,"Yes, relax."
Tutorial_300417,Uh...uhh... We've been stuck in here...for...for five days... Waah...
Tutorial_300418,Hiss... (Whisper) Looks like it's hard to trade now...
Tutorial_300419,You seem to have rescued all our companions. My gratitude.
Tutorial_300420,But there's this thing gnawing at me... Those cursed Gunners who robbed us are still on the loose.
Tutorial_300421,There's no law in the wasteland. Don't think too much.
Tutorial_300422,How about this? We know many Gunners are still hiding in this area. You'll have all the goods they took away from us if you can deal with them.
Tutorial_300423,Really? You don't mind?
Tutorial_300424,"We don't care about the goods now. All I want is to see the Gunners pay. But be careful, your enemies grow stronger as your exploration goes on. You'd better be wise."
Tutorial_300425,"Everyone from the Vault, it's me again."
Tutorial_300426,You want us to help you find more sugar bombs?
Tutorial_300427,"Ha, the news I've brought today is a little bit more interesting than a few boxes of sugar bombs."
Tutorial_300428,You know treasure is what lures Wastelanders. It's time to build a base where treasure hunters can rest up!
Tutorial_300429,"Enough of the talk, let's look at our new base!"
Tutorial_300430,"A base needs a hub to manage everything. This ""Roamer Lobby"" can be your command center."
Tutorial_300431,Building any other structure requires the Roamer Lobby.
Tutorial_300432,"Building or upgrading structures in the base needs some ""Sawed Maple."" These maple logs are firm after mutation caused by radiation... So don't worry..."
Tutorial_300433,Now let's check other structures.
Tutorial_300434,"For treasure-hunting Wastelanders, the most important thing is to have a place to trade their loots."
Tutorial_300435,Building and upgrading this Trade Center allows you to purchase at each faction's Redeem Shop!
Tutorial_300436,Perhaps you seek more thrilling experience than hunting treasures... The Quest Hub is where you should go.
Tutorial_300437,"In the Quest Hub, you can accept Bounty Quests from all factions, which provide you with extra incomes. But there's a daily limit for accepted Bounty Quests. Seize your chances!"
Tutorial_300438,"The higher the level of Quest Hub, the higher the difficulty of Bounty Quests to accept and better rewards."
Tutorial_300439,"Treasures in this area have all been dug up? Don't worry, we've turned this deserted military base into the Treasure Hunter Radio."
Tutorial_300440,The Treasure Hunter Radio provides treasure information that allows you to explore more areas!
Tutorial_300441,"Don't be scared. Looking like an arsenal that manufactures fat bombs, actually this Bomb Factory only produces sugar bombs."
Tutorial_300442,Building and upgrading the Bomb Factory allows you to earn more sugar bombs in you expeditions!
Tutorial_300443,"Well, let's build the Quest Hub and accept your first bounty quest!"
Tutorial_300444,Seems you've collected enough maple logs... Let's build the Bomb Factory now!
Tutorial_300445,"Tszz... Hiss... Friends from the Vault, how are you?"
Tutorial_300446,Kent? You old fella must be up to no good... See you!
Tutorial_300447,"Hey, no no no, I've got a good news; The Hubris Comics' Overseer Robot repairs are complete. Now you can proceed with your comic adventure in Hubris!"
Tutorial_300448,Forget about it... That broken robot nearly killed us. I might as well drink more cola at the Vault...and be a happy dweller...
Tutorial_300449,"I heard that broken robot has collected the independent comics of ""Manta Man!"""
Tutorial_300450,"Manta... You mean that Manta Man who had no fans and stopped publication, but turned into a rare resource and became extremely popular?"
Tutorial_300451,Eh...precisely. So care to embark on another Hubris Adventure?
Tutorial_300452,"Enough of talk, let's get moving!"
Tutorial_300453,"You know Hubris well. After adding Manta Man, we can unlock even more adventures."
Tutorial_300454,Now let's see what new comics we have!
Tutorial_300455,Good afternoon.
Tutorial_300456,"Who's there? Oh... Freaked me out. It's Pickman, the ""Bandit Killer."""
Tutorial_300457,Actually I'm a painter.
Tutorial_300458,"Well, the great painter, what are you doing here?"
Tutorial_300459,"Bandits, thieves and raiders are massing around Salem. Something's fishy."
Tutorial_300460,I'll go to investigate. Hope you'd join.
Tutorial_300461,Why should we help you? What's good in there for us?
Tutorial_300462,(Pickman casts you a cold glance as if his pupils could devour you.)
Tutorial_300463,"Very...very well, we'll help."
Tutorial_300464,Find me in the northern part of Salem. That's where raiders are most active. Don't keep me waiting.
Tutorial_300465,"(Whisper) Careful, Overseer, this guy makes me feel creepy."
Tutorial_300466,Will Pickman really meet us in Salem? This hell gives me goose bumps.
Tutorial_300467,Um...it's weird... It smells bad here.
Tutorial_300468,"(Appear) Good, you're on time."
Tutorial_300469,"Pickman, seems you've been here for a while. Have you scouted these parts?"
Tutorial_300470,"Yes, our target is the Salem Ruins. Raiders come in and out of it."
Tutorial_300471,Only you have the balls to roam about such place.
Tutorial_300472,Raiders? It's too quiet to believe raiders are here.
Tutorial_300473,Soon we'll know what they're up to... I'll go ahead.
Tutorial_300474,"Wait, aren't we supposed to walk together?"
Tutorial_300475,"Thanks, but I always act alone. (Leave)"
Tutorial_300476,Unfriendly...but so cool...
Tutorial_300477,"Overseer, Overseer?"
Tutorial_300478,"Overseer, watch out! The area you're exploring now emits a sort of...unspeakable power. Every step and action the squad take gradually leads them to madness..."
Tutorial_300479,Must...(Sizz)...stay sober...(Hiss)... Bonfire...(Tsss)...
Tutorial_300480,...(Sizz)...Finally! Are you okay?
Tutorial_300481,"No, Pickman's missing. Not good."
Tutorial_300482,"While I was trying to contact you, I detected a signal heading towards Salem. The signal was going along the Underground Water Vein under the Museum of Witchcraft."
Tutorial_300483,That must be Pickman! Let's catch up!
Tutorial_300484,Wait...(Sizz)...
Tutorial_300485,...(Sizzz)...Got it? Damn... What are you doing?! What happened?!
Tutorial_300486,Pickman has eliminated all cultists stationed in Salem. But he's gone mad. We must find him before he turns into another puppet of Azathoth the Elder Evil.
Tutorial_300487,Cultists? Puppets of the Elder Evil? No idea what you're talking about. But I told you not to believe Pickman! He is mad!
Tutorial_300488,"Compared to the Pickman now, he was a saint before... Then where should we find him?"
Tutorial_300489,Hold on... The Eye Bot I dispatched sent back an image...detecting the coast near the Salem...
Tutorial_300490,"Oh my, never saw such weather before... It's like that the waves are about to tear the sky apart! No stars to be seen here..."
Tutorial_300491,Starfall... We must hurry!
Tutorial_300492,Star...what? Say something that makes sense!
Tutorial_300493,Thanks for your help. I feel better already.
Tutorial_300494,You...you're welcome. What's it this time?
Tutorial_300495,"Although the Dunwich incident is over, I still feel like those unspeakable horrors linger..."
Tutorial_300496,All people back from Dunwich Digging Ground are saying this... It feels like they haven't awakened from the nightmare.
Tutorial_300497,"Perhaps what remains there are some evil illusions. But in case, we'd better clean them up."
Tutorial_300498,You want our squad to get back to that eerie place and fight god-knows-what monsters?
Tutorial_300499,(Shrug) Precisely. Know that violence is not the best way to solve problems... But it's always your Plan B.
Tutorial_300500,"Everyone from the Vault, howdy!"
Tutorial_300501,Tommy! My favorite arena boss! What brought you here?
Tutorial_300502,Well... I couldn't help notice that the Arena Radio's rating dropped lately... The gladiators seem a bit down...in spirits...
Tutorial_300503,"Yeah, perhaps they want love and peace after all this fighting..."
Tutorial_300504,No! Never! How could I make money without fighting in the arena?! I'm here to show you my new project: The Zenith Arena!
Tutorial_300505,"You must wonder what's special about the Zenith Arena. First of all, it's core is the ""Ladder Mode."""
Tutorial_300506,"The Ladder Mode is not available 24 hours a day like the Super Duper Mart. It's time limited. In the ""Ladder Mode,"" you can battle worthy opponents in Score."
Tutorial_300507,Win to gain more Score while lose...to reduce your Score.
Tutorial_300508,Of course I'm not some badass. I'll provide the Tier Protection for those who lost.
Tutorial_300509,"Every Sunday night, I'll give away bounties to contestants based on their tier. When a season of ""Ladder Mode"" ends, seasonal rewards will be given to all contestants according to the Score they earned."
Tutorial_300510,"It's too tiring? The Zenith Arena also features the ""Casual Mode"" which allows to enjoy a relaxing combat. The Casual Mode is available at any time."
Tutorial_300511,"And in the Casual Mode, all your dwellers' equipment, attachments and perks will be raised to Max level. Isn't it wonderful?"
Tutorial_300512,Come and create your dream team! Remember you must have at least 15 dwellers in your team for battle!
Tutorial_300513,Stop gawking! Come and fight!
Tutorial_300514,"Overseer, it seems one of our Dwellers is ready for Promotion training to become stronger."
Tutorial_300515,Only full-star Dwellers can be promoted when the Promotion is unlocked. Promoting Dwellers costs a certain amount of posters. Some specified Dwellers may also need Promotion Certificates.
Tutorial_300516,Congratulations! Let's get it promoted!
Tutorial_300517,"When a dweller has 3 medals in Promotion, they will acquire a new perk!"
Tutorial_300518,The new perk will be enhanced in effects and upgraded up to Lv.3 as the Dweller's Promotion level goes up.
Tutorial_300519,"Overseer, we received an ad from the National Guards Camp: ""Promotion Training Winter Camp,"" get trained here to give you a brand new feeling about your dwellers."
Tutorial_300520,"We'll just filter it out if you don't mind... What? You want to check it out? Alright, perhaps the winter camp will make our dwellers different."
Tutorial_300521,Here comes the Promotion Training Camp... Guess it's not a fake ad. They've prepared all kinds of drills.
Tutorial_300522,Complete training programs to get Promotion certificates that can be used to strengthen our Dwellers!
Tutorial_300523,Complete training programs to get advance certificates that can be used to strengthen our dwellers!
Tutorial_300524,"Friends from the Vault, excuse me, but it's urgent. We must get into action."
Tutorial_300525,"Lady Irma, anything we could help?"
Tutorial_300526,I've learned that you did the Hubris Adventure twice and I know someone's trying to turn Hubris comic characters into reality...and create chaos in the wasteland.
Tutorial_300527,"Yes, but since the ""Overseer"" Robot was abducted, we've lost the only lead."
Tutorial_300528,That's why I'm here. The technology of virtual reality used by Hubris Adventure is no different from that of Memory Den. A few adjustments would work.
Tutorial_300529,"Time is pressed. That Kent idiot is still waiting for us. I'll explain it later. Now we must hurry back to Hubris Comics and start a new ""Hubris Adventure!"""
Tutorial_300530,"As usual, tap comics to start our adventure."
Tutorial_300531,"Our enemies are cunning and powerful. To allow you to better deal with later adventures, I've adjusted the access mode of ""Hubris Adventure."""
Tutorial_300532,"Now you can challenge tougher enemies in ""Hubris Adventure""... Their power is beyond your comprehension... Good luck!"
Tutorial_300533,"Overseer, we found a weird Mr. Handy roaming around outside the Vault Door. We brought it back, as we figured, that's what you would have done."
Tutorial_300534,(Fully absorbed and enjoying the music)
Tutorial_300535,"Hey, I'm talking to you! Aren't you supposed to have something to tell us?"
Tutorial_300536,"Oh, right. Sorry. Playing recorded voice..."
Tutorial_300537,"Hey there! Friends from all vaults, here is the Guardian of Wasteland: Ma...chine... Mas...ter!"
Tutorial_300538,"Ho, a name quite imposing! But isn't Mechanist a villain?"
Tutorial_300539,"I'm contacting you because I... *Cough*... (Whisper) Come on, Isabel! You can do it... (no longer whispering) I need your help!"
Tutorial_300540,"Some of my minions...eh...are missing! Right, missing! And something's wrong with their program. They are attacking anyone on sight."
Tutorial_300541,So this is where you're needed t...turn off their power... Um...(Whisper) Phew! Finally it's over... How do you turn off this thing again?...
Tutorial_300542,"Interesting. Seems Mechanist has some secrets... Overseer, are you ready for a new adventure?"
Tutorial_300543,"What? We got visitors for real? ...*Cough*... I mean... (Low voice) Welcome, challengers! Are you prepared to face Mechanist's challenge?"
Tutorial_300544,Why are you talking like this... That's not your voice!
Tutorial_300545,"Non... Nonsense! This is my voice!... Anyway, my missing minions are equipped with some special modules."
Tutorial_300546,"If you could use these modules' features to your advantage and use a good combinations of dwellers, the combat will go much easier."
Tutorial_300547,"To help you face it more easily, I've got you a helper."
Tutorial_300548,"Knight Tara Astin, No.3431, I salute you!"
Tutorial_300549,She's a veteran markswoman from the Brotherhood. I believe her presence will be a great assistance.
Tutorial_300550,Invincible!
Tutorial_300551,"Waganee, enene, raga!"
Tutorial_300552,Eh... Anyway...this alien guy will help a lot.
Tutorial_300553,(The Alien stares at you in confusion)
Tutorial_300554,"With this helper, there's no stopping you. Alright, time to hit the road!"
Tutorial_300555,"Ah, bravo! Seems you've found a robots' den...filled with a group of minions dismissed...oh...no gone missing."
Tutorial_300556,"These dens require clearing out... Pass some little challenges I've set and you'll get a suuu...per reward! Sounds great, huh?"
Tutorial_300557,Congratulations! Here you're at my last trial! Seems I was right about you.
Tutorial_300558,"Um, I suppose you can tell us your true purpose now."
Tutorial_300559,Wh...what? You got me? Damn...
Tutorial_300560,"Alright, alright, I need you to pass these trials because I'm looking for warriors to help me deal with the Rustmen."
Tutorial_300561,Rustmen?
Tutorial_300562,They are a bunch of maniacs fond of modifying machines with which they use to plunder the Wastelanders. What blasphemy! Mutilating those poor machines!
Tutorial_300563,*Cough*... So what you'll face next is my Boss Trial! My ultimate test for you!
Tutorial_300564,Of course your vault doesn't stand alone in the Wasteland. So I made this Leaderboard for the Boss Trial to see who could be my best helper!
Tutorial_300565,"But before the [Challenge], it wouldn't hurt to do a little [Drill]. The [Drill] mode doesn't cost Radar Beacons, but you can't get rewards or achievements either."
Tutorial_300566,Ready? Have a go with Mechanist's Boss Trial! Wahahaha!
Tutorial_300581,Here you can view the current special rules and select suitable dwellers to deploy for better results.
Tutorial_300582,"If you can achieve certain goals I've set, you will get a rich reward. Don't tell people Mechanist is cheap!"
Tutorial_300583,"In the ""Boss Trial,"" my ultimate test for you, I will rank the damage dealt to the Boss by each Overseer in every combat."
Tutorial_300584,Compete with other Overseers on the Leaderboard and see who's the best helper to Mechanist! Wahaha!
Tutorial_300585,"Your first priority must be what you can get from me. Don't worry, you can redeem Mechanist's items at the shop 24/7!"
Tutorial_300586,"Well, all clear? Then (sharp voice) set off to face Mechanist's Challenge! ...(Whisper) Blasted broken voice changer..."
Tutorial_300567,"No! No! Overseer, a theft happened to the Vault. All the food ingredients that will help us get through the winter were stolen!"
Tutorial_300568,No way... I just checked the gate...and found no problem. Who could it be to steal our ingredients right on our watch?!
Tutorial_300569,My data shows...it's no human...
Tutorial_300570,What do you mean by that?
Tutorial_300571,"It's a fabled creature stealing food at the beginning of the new year... Seems it's called ""Nian!"""
Tutorial_300572,"What a weird name. Must be an ugly face... Alright, never mind. Let's get our food back or else we'll starve in the winter!"
Tutorial_300573,Here is Nian's den. Time to see what it looks like!
Tutorial_300574,It must have hoarded a lot! Not only from us...
Tutorial_300575,"Ha, we'll feast after finishing off it!"
Tutorial_300576,"Yeah, the chase emptied my belly. It will be dark after we get back to the Vault. Let's call the feast ""New Year's Eve Dinner!"""
Tutorial_300577,"Overseer, I guess you'll start the Rescue Mission again."
Tutorial_300578,"But hold on, did you see this flickering alarm? It means the Rescue Mission got something wrong this time."
Tutorial_300579,You might need to adjust your combat squad according to these special conditions. Guess it's a piece of cake for you.
Tutorial_300580,Over. Good luck!
Tutorial_300587,"Overseer, the Vault seems quite peaceful lately... Guess it won't hurt to take a holiday at times."
Tutorial_300588,"Vault buddies! Your old friend, Bounty Hunter MacCready, presents!"
Tutorial_300589,I have a bad feeling about this...
Tutorial_300590,"What? I've brought a priceless news! I just accepted a quest that says a mysterious ""beast"" is wandering in the Glowing Sea! It got a huge bounty on its head!"
Tutorial_300591,Sounds dangerous...
Tutorial_300592,Sounds a lucrative chance! What are you waiting for? Let the hunt begin!
Tutorial_300593,(Sigh)
Tutorial_300594,"Great, that's more like a Research Room."
Tutorial_300595,Now it's time to let the Research Department go deeper.
Tutorial_300596,"Look here. Now we can start the research of ""Arms Integration"" which allows our combat squad to fight better."
Tutorial_300597,"As the level of Research Room increases, more research projects will be unlocked."
Tutorial_300598,Let's choose a project and start research now!
Tutorial_300599,Good day. Please forgive my discourteous visit.
Tutorial_300600,"Pickman, you come and go like a shadow... You look very tired after the cultist incident."
Tutorial_300601,Yeah... It's hard to forget how I was driven mad by the Elder Evil... And that's why I'm here.
Tutorial_300602,What's wrong? A new cult appeared?
Tutorial_300603,"Since I regained my sanity from that endless madness, I've been investigating the Dunwich Borers."
Tutorial_300604,I found that the Elder Evil is far more fearsome than we had imagined... It's much older...and very terrifying...
Tutorial_300605,Don't overexert yourself Pickman. Fighting you in the madness again is the last thing we'd like to do.
Tutorial_300606,"Actually, the secret lies deep within the Dunwich Mine Pit."
Tutorial_300607,I need your help with the investigation of the Mine Pit... I can't do it myself in this condition.
Tutorial_300608,"Compared to your condition, I'm more concerned with your mind..."
Tutorial_300609,"Don't worry, I've figured out how to deal with those whispers."
Tutorial_300610,"Listen, during your exploration in the Mine Pit, you may hear some dreadful whispers that will make the battle more difficult."
Tutorial_300611,"But if you're prepared, your Reasonable Voice will quell them, which allows you to go deeper."
Tutorial_300612,"Well, are you ready to face the deep fear of Dunwich's Mine Pit again?"
Tutorial_300613,I don't want to go back to that hell! But...when was the last time Overseer took my advice?
Tutorial_300614,"Overseer, after preparations our combat squad is ready to head to the Capital Wasteland."
Tutorial_300615,"We've fixed the Pip-Boy Jacob left. Though the data inside suffered corruption, we managed to restore most of the Capital Wasteland data."
Tutorial_300616,Ready for a long journey? The Capital Wasteland is filled with wonders... Don't forget to bring back souvenirs!
Tutorial_300618,"Phew, seems we've reached the northeastern part of the Capital Wasteland."
Tutorial_300619,Keep it down. We can't be sure what people...or monsters...we'll encounter here.
Tutorial_300620,Start the exploration when you're ready. The cure for the FEV virus... I wonder where we can find it...
Tutorial_300621,"Dwellers of the Vault! The last adventure of ""Hubris Adventure"" is waiting for your access!"
Tutorial_300622,"After finishing this journey, the AI of super heroes will be no longer bound by their program. Then we can try to transplant them into synths..."
Tutorial_300623,Rumor has it that raiders in bizarre costumes have appeared everywhere. I'm sure they must be fake dwellers Peter sent to create chaos.
Tutorial_300624,"No time to waste. Everyone, this is our last chance!"
Tutorial_300625,"I've prepared the virtual reality of ""Hubris Adventure."" Ready?"
Tutorial_300626,"Everyone, you'll start from somewhere called ""Nuniverse"" this time. It's a interlayer intertwined in all time and space, dangerous yet intriguing."
Tutorial_300627,"According to my information, the last member of the Unstoppable Alliance, The Inspector, is nearby. But the roads here are blocked with obstacles. Some key secrets...are hidden..."
Tutorial_300628,"That's why I've prepared you the ""Investigation Notes."" Use it wisely and you'll approach and reveal the hidden secrets."
Tutorial_300629,"Use ""Investigation Notes"" to reveal the direction and distance of the Secret Room."
Tutorial_300630,"Use ""Investigation Notes"" in the Secret Room to immediately uncover the hidden secrets."
Tutorial_300631,Look! We've found the hidden secrets.
Tutorial_300632,"There are many secrets hidden in this world, most of which would be key to your quests. Using your ""Investigation Notes"" wisely will help you survive in this universe filled with perils."
Tutorial_300633,"Travelers, glad to see that you've helped Silver Shroud and Mistress of Mystery conquer their fear."
Tutorial_300634,But I'm afraid we have no time for a rest. Our interference has caused this unstable plane to start collapsing.
Tutorial_300635,You must find another time rift soon and head to where Grognak and Manta Man are.
Tutorial_300636,"To save your time, I'll lend you my Magic Hat."
Tutorial_300637,Placing it in a room opens a portal.
Tutorial_300638,Then you can use it again to teleport back to the room that hosts the portal.
Tutorial_300639,Good luck!
Tutorial_300640,"Everyone from the Vault, how are you?"
Tutorial_300641,Tommy! You look happy. Seems your Combat Zone business must be booming!
Tutorial_300642,You know it. I'm here to tell you that I've expanded the Zone. Now more players can join us in combat!
Tutorial_300643,Allow me to introduce my masterpiece...my precious World Arena!
Tutorial_300644,You need to create 3 teams to participate in the World Arena.
Tutorial_300645,Each team must contain at least 1 dweller.
Tutorial_300646,Seems you've created your teams! Now jump into World Arena and begin your battle!
Tutorial_300647,"Overseer, the Vault seems to be stable now. Perhaps you want to continue on."
Tutorial_300648,Check out what I've prepared for you!
Tutorial_300649,"Open the ""Travel Album"" here to view spots of interest in the Wasteland. They're just waiting to be explored!"
Tutorial_300650,"You may have visited some of them already, but it doesn't hurt go back for something new, right?"
Tutorial_300651,Embark on your journey now! Don't worry about the Vault. We can handle the party... (did I say party?) I mean we can handle everything while you're away.
Tutorial_300652,"Good day, Overseer. Let's see what's new today!"
Tutorial_300653,"Umm... Super mutants are grumpy as always, ghouls are hungry, the Institute and the Brotherhood are clashing... It seems like another normal peaceful day!"
Tutorial_300654,What about a story from the Astoundingly Awesome Tales? It is said that the Wasteland was invaded by fearsome enemies and nearly destroyed...
Tutorial_300655,And the enemies this time...came from Hell!
Tutorial_300656,"Hi, I'm VEGA. I'm delivering the support weapon named ""Plasma Rifle""... All done."
Tutorial_300657,"The ""Plasma Rifle"" is a tactical support weapon which deals energy damage."
Tutorial_300658,Killing demons in instances or picking up ammo from Twinkiling Spots will charge the support weapon.
Tutorial_300659,"As the battle goes on, I'll deliver more powerful support weapons and weapon modifications."
Tutorial_300670,"When ammo is fully replenished, you can use the support weapon to summon the Doom Slayer to assist in combat."
Tutorial_300660,Installing weapon mod... complete.
Tutorial_300661,Weapon mods change how the support weapon works and make it more effective.
Tutorial_300662,Look for Mod Bot in instances to switch the active weapon mod.
Tutorial_300663,Switching weapon mods based on your type of enemy is more efficient way to eliminate the Demonic Threat.
Tutorial_300664,"Delivering ""Rocket Launcher""... complete. It's a deadly weapon that deals physical damage."
Tutorial_300665,Now you may switch the support weapon before entering an instance.
Tutorial_300666,You can also switch the active weapon in instances via the Mod Bot. But remember some Mod Bots only work once.
Tutorial_300667,"Alert, high-concentration of demonic contamination detected. ""Eternal Rage"" enhanced mode activated."
Tutorial_300668,"The squad in ""Eternal Rage"" mode will accumulate ""Sloth"" faster while they are out of combat. When they have too much ""Sloth"" they will take damage and suffer from Radiation over time."
Tutorial_300669,"Killing demons restores the Doom Slayer's AP and reduces his ""Sloth"". Only non-stop killing ensures survival in ""Eternal Rage""."
Tutorial_300671,The Portal to Hell in Trinity Tower can not be shut down. Demons are flooding into the Wasteland via the bottom level of Trinity Tower.
Tutorial_300672,"Launching Project ""Ripatorium"": Before departing for Hell clean up the remaining demons in the tower to secure the Wasteland."
Tutorial_300673,The Doom Slayer loves tearing demons to pieces here.
Tutorial_300677,"Also, I've used Arms Bots to open a supply station for you to purchase combat supplies. Good luck with the hunt!"
Tutorial_300674,Strong demon activity spotted. Prepare for battle.
Tutorial_300675,Some strong demons are immune to different damage types. Remember to adjust your roster to deal with them.
Tutorial_300676,Switch support weapons based on these demons' immunities to deal the maximum amount of damage to them.
Tutorial_300678,"Hello, friends from the Vault! I'm Amari from the Memory Den."
Tutorial_300679,"Doctor Amari, did you just come running out of your lab? Did something happen?"
Tutorial_300680,"Yes, I detected a signal from the Capital Wasteland. Its MF is quite similar... to the Memory Den's."
Tutorial_300681,"Through comprehensive analysis, I've found it is coming from Vault 112!"
Tutorial_300682,This is huge! Is there anything we can do to help?
Tutorial_300683,"As far as I know, Vault 112 has cutting-edge virtual reality tech. I'd like you to test it as the Memory Den is in dire need of data."
Tutorial_300684,Enter Vault 112 from here and start your journey into the virtual world!
Tutorial_300685,"Of course, the virtual world has special rules. That's why I've prepared this 'Guide to Virtual Reality'. Hope it helps..."
Tutorial_300686,"Ah, friend... I've noticed you've made some delicate modifications to some attachments."
Tutorial_300687,I guess there's nothing to hide. The chips and toolkits you used for remaking attachments actually belong to Enclave.
Tutorial_300688,"Of course, they were just prototypes. I've found more advanced Enclave tech that allow you to boost attachments even further."
Tutorial_300689,"Same as before, you can trade these techs with Sugar Bombs you find in the Mysterious Treasure! Fair price!"
Tutorial_300690,What are you gawking at? Brand new Enclave techs await you!
Tutorial_300691,The Wasteland dwellers have been teleported successfully. Analyzing environment...
Tutorial_300692,You have arrived in the peripheral area of Hell. This is where the Night Sentinels used to battle demons. Relics of the Night Sentinels are still scattered here.
Tutorial_300693,I've detected a very familiar life signal...
Tutorial_300694,"The so-called ""Betrayer"" of the Night Sentinels is nearby. Due to remorse, he decided to banish himself forever in the depths of Hell."
Tutorial_300695,We must find him. He may offer assistance to our mission.
Tutorial_300696,Dwellers lost the support weapon while teleporting... A new support weapon is being delivered...success.
Tutorial_300697,The Tactical Shotgun is one of the first weapons the Doom Slayer used. It can unleash stunning powers in capable hands.
Tutorial_300698,New combat mode activated. Now you can select the difficulty before entering the instance.
Tutorial_300699,"""Heavy Vulcan"" delivered."
Tutorial_300700,Heavy Vulcan is a powerful support weapon that provides suppressive fire when surrounded.
Tutorial_300701,Your arms have been modified. Now you're able to switch your support weapon.
Tutorial_300702,"Overseer, our terminal has received a blueprint from Caravans."
Tutorial_300703,Seems finally we can build a Trade Center in the Vault! Wonderful!
Tutorial_300704,"In the Trade Center, you can use resources, blueprints or posters to redeem rare items from Caravans!"
Tutorial_300705,So let's start to build a Trade Center!
Tutorial_300706,"Overseer, many strong dwellers have joined the Vault. But our resources are limited. We can't feed everyone."
Tutorial_300707,"So...if you'd like to switch the dweller you want to develop most, you can use ""Power Transfer"" to save plenty of resources."
Tutorial_300708,"Look, you can ""transfer"" a dweller's combat memory in another's brain. It even works with dogs and synths. Isn't it amazing?"
Tutorial_300709,"Everyone from the Vault, we meet again."
Tutorial_300710,Minutemen's scouts have made progress in Quincy. Our target...has returned to Quincy.
Tutorial_300711,Target? You mean?
Tutorial_300712,The traitor of Minutemen. The man who sold us all out...Clint!
Tutorial_300713,"We must go to Quincy and find Clint, and to avenge our brothers who died in Quincy!"
Tutorial_300714,"Overseer, reports have it Trinity Tower has been captured by some villains again."
Tutorial_300715,Why do they always like somewhere high?
Tutorial_300716,"Alright, cut the crap. Let's reclaim the tower!"
Tutorial_300717,But be careful. I heard enemies are special this time. Prepare yourself!
Tutorial_300718,"Everyone of the Vault, the Power of the Atom let us meet again."
Tutorial_300719,"(Whisper) Take care, Overseer, these people are a bit superstitious."
Tutorial_300720,The Atom Pit needs your help. A group of silly raiders has disturbed her peace.
Tutorial_300721,"They took some of our followers. Please, bring back my brothers and sisters."
Tutorial_300722,"Only back in the Atom Pit, can they find peace in the great fission."
Tutorial_300723,"Overseer, we've suddenly received a lot of requests from dwellers! Too many for us to handle!"
Tutorial_300724,"What has been confirmed is that in the central area of Commonwealth Wasteland, massive FEV virus leakage was detected and survivors were attacked by mutants and mutant creatures."
Tutorial_300725,"What now? Overseer, I suppose this is too much for our Vault."
Tutorial_300726,"Forgive my discourtesy, seems you need help from the Institute."
Tutorial_300727,The Institute is quite...concerned with the FEV leakage. We hope you could summon your companions to build an Investigation Group and venture deep in the FEV Infection Zone.
Tutorial_300728,"Wait, how did you know...we'd help you?"
Tutorial_300729,The Institute will provide you with support in the course as well as unimaginable reward for FEV samples you collect.
Tutorial_300730,This... But...
Tutorial_300731,You need help from the Institute to neutralize the threat of mutants and FEV. And the Institute needs your samples. Isn't it a win-win proposal?
Tutorial_300732,Fine... No time to ponder. So how are we gonna join the Investigation Group?
Tutorial_300733,Simple. Just sign here...and no need to read the Terms of Use!
Tutorial_300734,"Well, seems you have reached the FEV Infection Zone. Now Field Agent Dr. Zimmer will explain how the Investigation Group and Investigation Team work."
Tutorial_300735,Newbies again? Looks I got not enough troubles? (Sighs) Here. Each Investigation Team will have a starting tile.
Tutorial_300736,Your job is to let the Investigation Team capture more adjacent tiles and push slowly to the center of FEV Infection Zone.
Tutorial_300737,Let's pick a tile now. Guess you can't wait.
Tutorial_300738,"For each captured tile, we'll send agents to collect Mutant Biospecimen. You can also station a dweller to increase the yield."
Tutorial_300739,"There is a limit of tiles to capture for each Investigation Team. To push it through to the center, you have to withdraw some tiles."
Tutorial_300740,You can also promote your rank in the Investigation Group to increase that limit.
Tutorial_300741,Seems you have gathered enough Mutant Biospecimen. The Institute's Biotechs can be researched with your samples.
Tutorial_300742,"Now select a Biotech for upgrade! The deeper you explore the FEV Infection Zone, the more powerful Biotechs you need."
Tutorial_300743,"What's this? Overseer, seems our dweller has retrieved a valuable Trinket buried in memories. Now let's see what a ""Trinket"" is!"
Tutorial_300744,A dweller with trinket can unlock his or her trinket when reaching 4-star.
Tutorial_300745,A dweller's trinket has its own level. Use Memory Images to upgrade trinkets.
Tutorial_300746,Upgrading trinkets can increase the base stats an trinket provides.
Tutorial_300747,"Meanwhile, a dweller's trinket also has its own rank. Use Diaries and Trinket Replicas to increase the rank."
Tutorial_300748,"When a trinket's rank is increased, its rank ability will be enhanced to unleash true powers."
Tutorial_300749,"Trinket section has been newly opened in the mall, let's check it out!"
Tutorial_300750,"Look. The trinket replicas, diaries and memory images for sale can be used to rank up trinkets."
Tutorial_300751,Feel free to pick!
Tutorial_300752,We have come to the Creator's home planet: Urdak.
Tutorial_300753,"Support weapons have all been delivered. We must act swiftly. Any second now, Khan Maykr will know that we're here."
Tutorial_300754,It appears that Dr. Samuel Hayden's locator is nearby. We believe that he can be of help to us.
Tutorial_300755,"The Overseer, a truly warm-hearted Wastelander, has mailed us a new blueprint. We can now build the ""VR Room"" in our vault."
Tutorial_300756,"The ""VR Room"" allows us to experience heroic stories from the past through the power of virtual reality technology. Perhaps we can find something useful in them."
Tutorial_300757,"Well, let's build a ""VR Room"" now!"
Tutorial_300758,Now let's see how the VR Room works.
Tutorial_300759,You can unlock the memory files of dwellers whom have joined our vault.
Tutorial_300760,Nice! It looks like that our dwellers are grateful to you for helping them unlock their memories. They have given us some gifts.
Tutorial_300761,"After unlocking the memory files, we can relive the dweller's past experiences in the VR Room."
Tutorial_300762,"Warning: When experiencing the dwellers' stories, no friendly Dweller can take part in the battle. The only dweller you control will be the one whose past you are experiencing."
Tutorial_300763,The story of each dweller is different. Advance with caution by following hints in the memory. Sometimes you can avoid encounters altogether. So keep a sharp eye out and your wits even sharper!
Tutorial_300764,The death of Khan Maykr has disrupted the delicate balance of Urdak. The chaotic demons will soon reign supreme.
Tutorial_300765,"Meanwhile, the Icon of Sin grows ever closer to our planet. His mere presence can bend the fabric of reality. Only the Doom Slayer possesses a will strong enough to face them."
Tutorial_300766,"We must get to the portal as soon as possible to stop him. The longer the Icon of Sin stays on Earth, the closer we are to damnation!"
Tutorial_300767,"Overseer, there are enough Dwellers in our vault now. This ""Classroom"" allows us to provide Dwellers with a more thorough education, resulting in them becoming more accustomed to life in the vault."
Tutorial_300768,"Look over here, you can place the Dweller into the Gallery in the classroom."
Tutorial_300769,"That way, after you have unlocked the corresponding Dweller in the ""Dweller Gallery,” you can have them begin the classes. Even Dogmeat can learn a lot here."
Tutorial_300770,"When Dweller's Ranks increase, you can upgrade their courses in the Dweller Gallery."
Tutorial_300771,"After upgrading, Dwellers can get additional buffs from the gallery."
Tutorial_300772,"After you have upgraded the classroom, you can also assign Dwellers to become mentors, which further boosts classroom buff effects."
Tutorial_300773,"Therefore, building and upgrading this Trade Center will allow us to buy more items from the Shop!"
Tutorial_300774,"The higher the Quest Hub's level, the more rewards and rarer Bounty quests we can get."
Tutorial_300775,Making use of the Treasure Hunter Radio allows us to increase the number of Bounty Quests we can accept along with their duration.
Tutorial_300776,Building and upgrading the Bomb Factory gives us more Hunt Challenge attempts!
Tutorial_300777,"Hey, Overseer. We heard some news from that town over there. It seems the Crimson Caravan left some items at Quincy. Would you be interested in checking it out with me?"
Tutorial_300778,"Don't get your hopes up, Quincy was cleaned out a long time ago."
Tutorial_300779,"You're right. This lead might be a hoax, but we should still check it out. Maybe we'll run into something good."
Tutorial_300780,"...Okay, I hope it's worth our while."
Tutorial_300781,"Hey, who are you people? Are you here for the treasure too?"
Tutorial_300782,"Seems like the people we were expecting are already here. Now, please hand over the treasure map or just lead us straight to the loot."
Tutorial_300783,We won't tell you a thing about the treasure. Run!
Tutorial_300784,"So you let them get away, just like that?"
Tutorial_300785,"Overseer, we've got work to do."
Tutorial_300786,"In this battle, you can use your super weapon repeatedly and it will charge over time. You should <color=#ff3333>switch</color> different super weapons to deal with different kinds of demons."
Tutorial_300787,<color=#00583FFF>Saw</color>: Can damage the <color=#00583FFF>Icon of Sin</color> directly\n<color=#ff3333>Doomblade</color>: Cuts the enemy open without <color=#ff3333>Physical Resistance</color> <color=#4233ffff>\nBFG</color>: Vaporizes enemies without <color=#4233ffff>Energy Resistance</color>
Tutorial_300788,Welcome! I am Bottle and this is Cap. Welcome to Nuka World!
Tutorial_300789,Welcome to our Nuka World Vacation!
Tutorial_300790,"First, allow me to take you on the scenic route. Nuka World is quite a unique place."
Tutorial_300791,Why?
Tutorial_300792,"Anywhere you go, you'll need a little bit of... luck."
Tutorial_300793,Luck?
Tutorial_300794,"That's right. Have you noticed this dice? If you want to go anywhere, you must roll it first. The number you roll is the distance you can advance."
Tutorial_300795,I see. What if I want to do more than just move around this area?
Tutorial_300796,"No problem. Do you see that big scary monster? If you can defeat it, you'll get dynamite which can be used to blast open roadblocks and unlock a new area!"
Tutorial_300797,Why are there roadblocks?! Where do these monsters come from anyways?
Tutorial_300798,"Don't worry about the small details! Anyways, it's a really big park. It's big enough to kill... oh, I mean, to have fun."
Tutorial_300799,Is this park more for relaxation or to put people to work?
Tutorial_300800,"Aside from enjoying our amazing attractions, you might also come across a Nuka World Raffle Ticket! As long as you have enough of them, you can go to the big roulette wheel near the park map. By tapping on the wheel you can get some awesome rewards!"
Tutorial_300801,These rewards are pretty good...
Tutorial_300802,"Wow! Looks like our workers can't wait to help us clean up the place! Well, enjoy your stay here!"
Tutorial_300803,"If you still have any questions, don't bother us! You can find many answers from the self-help machine over there. Now we're going to enjoy Nuka World! Good luck!"
Tutorial_300804,"Overseer, thank you for your hard work over the last year. Because of you, the Vault has become so amazing. We can see you put in a lot of hard work during the Vaults development..."
Tutorial_300805,"Bleh, I can't read the rest. Piper's writing is so bad. Overseer, take off your Christmas hat now, you still have to work on Christmas. Don't waste time listening to their chatter!"
Tutorial_300806,Are you still singing that song about Christmas? Our broadcast station has confirmed the location of the songs. We should send someone to investigate and make sure that this isn't some strange scheme.
Tutorial_300807,"Keep your complaints to yourself. Now, we should open the map and see where that place is. Use your role as an Overseer to make everyone on vacation get back to work!"
Tutorial_300808,"Therefore, the story of Santa is derived from the sagas of the Viking warriors. Legend has it that the carols we hear today are actually the war cries of Santa Claus."
Tutorial_300809,"On Christmas Eve, he will lead the charge with his reindeer chariot. Out of respect and fear, it is referred to as the ""Silent Night.” In his wake, he throws the spoils of war down the chimneys of all good children."
Tutorial_300810,"Miss Browning, there is a discrepancy between the story you told me and the information I found."
Tutorial_300811,Don't believe that hogwash. Nobody knows Christmas as well as I do!
Tutorial_300812,"People, hold the history lesson. We have a guest..."
Tutorial_300813,God! Please help me!
Tutorial_300814,Is that... a woman in a reindeer costume? Or is it a reindeer turned into a human?!
Tutorial_300815,"That's not the point! Kind people, I need your help! I am Santa Claus's Reindeer. I was attacked on my way to deliver gifts. Santa Claus has been captured!"
Tutorial_300816,"Do you mean someone was kidnapped? Oh, kidnappings happen a lot during this time of year... No! Not Santa Claus!"
Tutorial_300817,"It's true! If you don't believe me, just follow me! We fell somewhere not far from here! If you can rescue Santa Claus, I believe that he will offer you some great gifts!"
Tutorial_300818,"Although this cosplay reindeer girl is quite odd, we can't just leave the kidnapped Santa Claus alone during Christmas!"
Tutorial_300819,We should send out some people to investigate. It's best that we bring both Santa Claus and his gifts back.
Tutorial_300820,"Oh! Gosh, look over there! I have never seen a Christmas tree this big in my entire life!"
Tutorial_300821,"Come in, Dwellers. We found this lucky star and a flyer from that Raider camp. It says here we can get gifts by using this Lucky Star to play a game under the Christmas tree!"
Tutorial_300822,You mean a free gift? I have never come across something so amazing in my entire life! A giant Christmas tree and a free gift. What a great Christmas!
Tutorial_300823,"Alright, Overseer. Wipe that drool off your face. Even though our main mission is to find Santa Claus, I think we still have some time to play a game under the tree. It's up to you."
Tutorial_300824,Overseer! Stop hiding! We need money! Something terrible happened!
Tutorial_300825,"Do you remember that Nian monster we defeated last year? It appears it's cousin is here to get payback. Not just that, it also gathered a ton of terrifying monsters from the Wasteland!"
Tutorial_300826,"These monsters are running rampant! They have destroyed many settlements in the Wasteland, and the Wastelanders can't seem to defeat them. All the dwellers have gathered here, what should we do?"
Tutorial_300827,Seems like the final target for its revenge is us. The monster army is approaching!
Tutorial_300828,Alert! Alert! Radiation alert!
Tutorial_300829,"Oh my god... Look, the monsters are even more powerful than before! We need to hold out until we can find their weaknesses."
Tutorial_300830,"Despite the monsters being powerful, the dwellers of the Wasteland have still gathered to make their stand. Now you can command them in battle to fight the monsters and the Nian beast."
Tutorial_300831,"Because of this bottleneck, we can only deploy 15 dwellers to battle at a time. The chosen dwellers will have to hold out until each wave is over. Think carefully when you put together a team."
Tutorial_300832,"This is a critical mission, we are the last hope for the Wasteland. You must remember: if you screw this up, we will be the ones served at the New Year's meal."
Tutorial_300833,"The monsters are coming from different directions. They will be coming one after another so we can't wait, we need to destroy them before the next wave comes! We don't want to have to deal with them next year!"
Tutorial_300834,"Hey... Hello... hello! Can you hear me? Don't pretend to be dead, I know you can hear me!"
Tutorial_300835,"I'll speak first. I think Preston's way of commanding like a ""general"" is very effective. Therefore, I have some orders for you, so just shut up and follow them."
Tutorial_300836,"No complaints. Nate never complains when Preston tells him what to do. Besides, completing these special quests always come with great rewards!"
Tutorial_300837,"Okay, let me give you three quests first. You only need to complete each of them once daily, but don't you go slacking off! You have to be careful!"
Tutorial_300838,"Get a move on! Complete your first special quest of the new year! Of course, after that... the Vault's banquet will be waiting for you."
Tutorial_301001,"After having 1 Medal or more, the Dweller will acquire a new perk!"
Tutorial_301002,"The Vault's Living Quarters are still a bit... run down. <playername>, we must expand our Living Quarters if we want to add more Dwellers. Let's make it bigger and fancier."
Tutorial_301003,"When you have <color=#2b669d>completed</color> an Instance, you will be able to use the <color=#2b669d>Sweep</color> feature on it to quickly acquire its resources."
Tutorial_301004,"With the number of battles the Dwellers have been through, they can already handle these monsters by themselves. As the Overseer, you can make a cup of coffee during the <color=#2b669d>Auto Battle</color> and enjoy a lazy afternoon."
Tutorial_301005,"Overseer, the ""G.K.D. Time Manipulation System"" developed by Vault-Tec can help increase the efficiency of our combat squad. Let's try it out now!"
Tutorial_301006,"From our adventure in Vault 112, we have acquired some <color=#2b669d>Combat Attachments</color>... Uhhh... don't worry about the details..."
Tutorial_301007,"When a dweller with Trinkets reaches 5 medals, they can unlock their own Trinket system."
Tutorial_301008,Only a Dweller with a max Advancement rank unlocked can advance. Advancing a Dweller will cost posters.
Tutorial_301009,"Hello again, my friends! Remember me? I am Amari of the memory bank."
Tutorial_301010,"Dr. Amari, pleasure to have you here. What can we do for you?"
Tutorial_301011,"The research in Base 112 has progressed to a deeper level, and I have discovered something deeper and more complex in this virtual reality."
Tutorial_301012,"Depth virtual reality will lead you to a more profound and painful experience, but you will get more experimental data than ever before."
Tutorial_301013,Does that also mean that it's more...dangerous?
Tutorial_301014,"I already have an understanding of the depth virtual reality: At the end of each depth virtual reality, there is a node that involves various terrible things"
Tutorial_301015,"Complete this node to end the data exploration. Remember, there are a lot of unknowns awaiting you ahead!"
Tutorial_301016,"Some rules of depth virtual reality have changed, so we updated this ""Adventure Guide of Virtual Reality"" that we presented to you before. Hope it helps!"
Tutorial_200101,Gosh! How dare you taking me to the battlefield? Send your squad to the visible room forward to ensure our safety!
Tutorial_200102,How dare you taking me to the battlefield? You are a ... Watch out! We can see the situation in neighboring rooms. Don't get me killed!
Tutorial_200103,"You don't want to leave me here, do you? This is the staircase that can lead to other floors. And I even have to tell you that."
Tutorial_200104,Look! This member of your squad is full of AP. Order him to unleash their special combat ability!
Tutorial_200105,"Accumulate AP, release, accumulate again and release again. See? I've told you everything about it!"
Tutorial_200106,"While exploring, you'd better open your eyes widely, because we often stumble upon some useful items."
Tutorial_200107,"This thing is... well, you don't need to know what it is. It's too complicated to explain, but it is a Chem that can affect your squad's battle performance."
Tutorial_200108,Some chems last a long time and some don't. Be careful when using them.
Tutorial_200109,"Wow, this is the Mysterious Merchant, like in the Wasteland tales. We are so lucky to run into them! They have loads of good stuff..."
Tutorial_200110,Caution! Your Combat Team has been assessed and is far from optimal. More training required!
Tutorial_200111,"Did you see that? The Central Intelligence can analyze the data of each location, give us a difficulty coefficient and compare that with the Power of our Combat Team."
Tutorial_200112,"Yo, Overseer! Why are you hustlin' here? Do you want to avoid the daily missions and go out on a date?"
Tutorial_200113,"Don't worry! Although there is no holiday, everyone still prepared chocolate for you. But for the health of your pancreas and your teeth, I thought I would help so I already put the chocolates away for you."
Tutorial_200114,"(Chewing) Of course I'll give them to you. But you must remember that you have some new combat missions today, right?"
Tutorial_200115,"(Chewing) I have posted the mission here. Today is Valentine's Day, so I made it with a festive atmosphere."
Tutorial_200116,(Chewing) Let me repeat! Remember to pay attention to the description of the mission before fighting. I'll wish you a happy Valentine's Day after the battle.
Tutorial_200117,(Chewing) What I am eating? No! It's definitely not your chocolate. Absolutely not! I'm not that kind of person!
Tutorial_200118,"Overseer, get up! Something went wrong out in the Capital Wasteland. Many Vaults sent us an SOS. They said that there was a loud noise on Mount Mabel. However, when we got there, we only found blood and ashes."
Tutorial_200119,"Although it is far away from us, if we can't stop the attack on the Wasteland, it will not take long before it comes to our lands."
Tutorial_200120,"There is a saying, if the lips are gone, the teeth will be cold. It isn't the time for you to sleep in! Hurry up and send men into the Capital Wasteland. You need to establish a base there and start looking into the issue!"
Tutorial_200121,Vault! Vault! Can you hear me?
Tutorial_200122,"We have reached Mount Mabel and built a camp. Everything was fine on the way here, but I have a question to ask."
Tutorial_200123,Who gave us the Mount Mabel map?
Tutorial_200124,Of course it was me. Have you forgotten? It was I that prepared the map for you!
Tutorial_200125,Then you must have given me the wrong map. The map you gave me is completely different from the mountainous terrain.
Tutorial_200126,What? Then this must be not the map I gave you!
Tutorial_200127,"No! More precisely, other parts of the map are correct, and only the Mount Mabel part does not match. And... it feels like that Mount Mabel has changed."
Tutorial_200128,This is not...Mount Mabel!
Tutorial_200129,Are you sure you didn't go to the wrong place?
Tutorial_200130,"Sure! The terrain here is weird. The foot of the mountain is still normal, but everything else has changed, starting with the mountainside, even the species of trees and the soil conditions. It looks like that entire mountain area has been completely changed."
Tutorial_200131,"You mean... Someone replaced the mountain and made the loud noise? How could this be, it's such a big mountain!"
Tutorial_200132,There is no other explanation. We will explore the surroundings and draw a map. Over!
Tutorial_200133,This is a good place to take a break.
Tutorial_200134,"Fortunately, I have these items. They can enhance my current equipment."
Tutorial_200135,"This forest is terrifying, and there are sure to be creatures more horrible than these dogs. I must get prepared for them."
Tutorial_200136,"Okay, Overseer, we have found something useful. This cat girl must know something, but she seems to think we are mercenaries."
Tutorial_200137,"She is willing to hire us to help her return to her world, while at the same time restore Mount Mabel. We believe that the mysterious power that destroyed the Capital Wasteland came from here. As long as the mountain is moved back, I believe that everything will be restored. On this point, we share the same interest as the cat girl."
Tutorial_200138,"Moreover, helping her will earn gold! It's the first time that someone has agreed to pay us in years. I'm so moved I could cry."
Tutorial_200139,"The customer is the king! Overseer, you have to serve this cat girl well. Don't talk back and do whatever she asks."
Tutorial_200140,The team dispatched to explore the mountain reports that they have found a deep crypt in the mountainside.
Tutorial_200141,"According to the Cat Girl, this is a tomb, that is to say we might find some valuables inside!"
Tutorial_200142,"Of course, we do this for scientific research, we are not tomb raiders, absolutely not!"
Tutorial_200143,"Well done, Overseer! With my assistance, we managed to send the mountain and the dragon back!"
Tutorial_200144,"But it seems that our Vault needs to welcome a new Dweller. Miss Cat forgot to teleport herself back. Sure enough, cats are very forgetful."
Tutorial_200145,"It seems that there wasn't enough magic power, so only the top of the mountain was sent back, leaving the crypt behind."
Tutorial_200146,I hope that the treasures inside are still there. Let's explore the crypt before it closes.
Tutorial_200150,Do you want to keep this crypt opn?! Saashi does not support you going to explore it. You should close it!
Tutorial_200151,Why? Hasn't the snowy mountain been teleported back?
Tutorial_200152,"The problem is that it was left behind. After all, it's something that doesn't belong to this world. It might attract something terrible from Tamriel!"
Tutorial_200153,Another dragon?
Tutorial_200154,"That's possible! In short, you can only explore the upper level, and never open the deeper ones! God knows what dangers are inside!"
Tutorial_200147,"We were deceived by a cat! I can't believe it! Overseer, you didn't realize that she had a relationship with that dragon!"
Tutorial_200148,"Anyway, we can't trust her anymore! We need to cooperate with the local Brotherhood!"
Tutorial_200149,"Let's send a team to meet the Brotherhood, I believe that we can shoot the dragon down!"
Tutorial_200168,"Welcome back to the guild! There are some new changes, so please pay attention."
Tutorial_200155,"Good news! As more and more members join the guild, we now have the ability to build some awesome buildings."
Tutorial_200156,"I have been envious of the Minutemen's cannon for a long time. With this kind of support weapon, we will definitely shine in battle."
Tutorial_200157,So I asked Sturges to help us get a lot of support weapon blueprints.
Tutorial_200158,"Each kind of support weapon has a different effect. When they are built, they will definitely help us in future rescue events!"
Tutorial_200159,"In addition to these, we also need to maintain and increase the equipment in the guild building."
Tutorial_200160,"We can build new equipment here to help maintain the operation of the guild, or just make things more fun."
Tutorial_200161,"In short, the guild is our home, and it relies on the effort of every member to make it more powerful. Don't slack off!"
Tutorial_200162,"Overseer, get up! Happy Harvest Day! To celebrate our performance over the past year, everyone can relax for a day."
Tutorial_200163,"But you can't rest yet, there is an urgent mission for you."
Tutorial_200164,"Do you remember Vault 996? Yes, it is the largest Vault in the Wasteland. It has a complete production plant and abundant resources, many survivors went there as a result."
Tutorial_200165,"But yesterday, two Dwellers who fled Vault 996 fled came to us. They were hungry and tired."
Tutorial_200166,They didn't say a word but looked very scared when we mentioned Vault 996. It seems that something terrible has happened over there.
Tutorial_200167,We can't just be bystanders when another Vault is in trouble. We need to find out what happened to Vault 996.
核子可乐世界二期新手引导,
Tutorial_200207,Welcome! I really didn't expect us to meet in the new theme park!
Tutorial_200208,Bottle thought that you were exhausted from the previous park.
Tutorial_200209,"Cap, your EQ is so low! You should say ""I believe that you must have over-enjoyed yourself in the previous park""."
Tutorial_200210,"Since you're here, let's continue working... Oh no I mean, spend the holiday in this mint-flavored Nuka-Cola Park."
Tutorial_200211,I believe everyone is familiar with the rules of Nuka-World. Remember to roll this dice to try your luck in the new area.
Tutorial_200212,"If you want to reach the next area, remember to defeat those monsters and get the corresponding explosives to remove the barricades. However, the monsters in this area are more ferocious and can weaken your resistances!"
Tutorial_200216,"But don't worry, once you finish these buildings you can create enhanced extra armor. Then you can fight against the powerful monsters in this area!"
Tutorial_200213,Calm down. Remember to use the Nuka-Cola Tokens in the new theme park! Don't forget to spin the big Roulette wheel!
Tutorial_200214,"Considering that you were a bit lonely in the previous theme park, this time we will accompany you to play mini games in some areas!"
Tutorial_200215,Let's see if you can get the gifts we prepared!
核子可乐世界三期新手引导,
Tutorial_200217,"For the safety of the tourists, Cap and I strongly recommend you do not enter this area! Let me repeat! This area has been occupied by a group of lunatics!"
Tutorial_200218,"Yes! The original robots and actors here have gone mad. Now they keep shouting ""X-Force Awakening"" and fighting each other every day!"
Tutorial_200219,Really! These weirdos are much more terrifying than the Disciples. We don't dare come here during normal times.
Tutorial_200220,"But since you're here, why don't you try it? Maybe you can beat the crazy robots and the 2 lunatics!"
Tutorial_200221,"That's right! As long as you can take care of the situation here, Nuka-World will surely be peaceful again!"
Tutorial_200222,"In addition, I want to ride the Galaxy Speeder!"

Tutorial_200246,I'm a human! Do I look like a green man to you?!
Tutorial_200247,Don't you think it's weird for a human to dress like this on earth?
Tutorial_200248,"Well, you're right. I have not seen humans for a long time and forgotten. As you can see, the only ones I meet are Jangles and the weirdos before me!"

Tutorial_200252,"Don't look at me like that! I didn't lie to you! If I can't defeat Zorbo, Earth will be in danger!"
Tutorial_200253,Really? I thought the Earth was already in danger.
Tutorial_200254,"Worse than it is now! Zorbo is an evil alien, he wants to eliminate all creatures on earth and make it into his colony!"
Tutorial_200255,"I tried to stop him, but he blocked the road and had his robots to guard it. With just me and Jangles we dont stand a chance, so I need your help!"
Tutorial_200256,"Zorbo has collected a lot of things in his lab. As long as you help me defeat Zorbo, I'll give those things to you!"

Tutorial_200258,You must eliminate Zorbo's robots first. Here is our starting point.
Tutorial_200259,"Before, Jangles and I didn't have enough firepower, but with you, we can now do it!"
Tutorial_200260,Follow me! For Earth!!

Tutorial_200263,You mean... Zorbo is a evil alien doctor who is trying to take over Earth?
Tutorial_200264,"Yes! He's been eyeing Earth for a long time. Earth is a mild planet suitable for life. It happens that human beings are fighting with each other, so he decided to take the chance to eliminate all of mankind!"
Tutorial_200265,"I once defeated him in a spaceship outside the Earth, but I didn't think he was still alive, hiding here."
Tutorial_200266,"I searched for a long time before I spotted him. At that time, he began producing a robot army with the equipment here."
Tutorial_200267,"He kept capturing Raiders and using them to study the human body. If we don't stop him, Earth will be in danger!"
Tutorial_200268,"Well, it seems that the condition of these two people are more serious than we thought."
Tutorial_200269,"However, everything is possible in this park."

Tutorial_200271,Zorbo! Today is your last day! My comrads from Earth and I will stop you!
Tutorial_200272,"Hah, I thought that no one likes you except your monkey. Poor human! You chose the wrong ally."
Tutorial_200273,"I dont care about your allies, but I can help you find a doctor for when I am done with you."
Tutorial_200274,"Hah, you're so considerate, but I won't get hurt!"
Tutorial_200275,...Alright! As long as you are happy.
Tutorial_200276,Ridiculous human! Let me show you lower critters the wisdom that exists outside your small planet!
Tutorial_200277,"That's all? Zorbo, I defeated you in space, and I can also defeat you here!"
Tutorial_200278,"Hahaha! Captain Cosmos, your IQ must be the same as your monkeys! Do you think you'd get me without fighting?!"
Tutorial_200279,I don't care what you are going to do! Now I will kill you!
Tutorial_200280,Naive! Have you forgotten something? I can run away anytime!
Tutorial_200281,Haha! Your spaceship has crashed. You have no way to escape now!
Tutorial_200282,"My spacecraft has crashed, but your spacecraft is still there! Do you think I studied nothing except poison? I've unlocked your spaceship's security system and door! Goodbye, Captain Cosmos, or should I say, Captain of Earth!"
Tutorial_200283,What?! Stop him!
Tutorial_200284,Damn! He got away!
Tutorial_200285,Don't stand there gawking! Go back to my spaceship and stop him!
Tutorial_200286,Zorbo! You'll never get away!
Tutorial_200287,Damn! I just found the energy you hid!
Tutorial_200288,This is the last thing you can do on Earth!
Tutorial_200289,Hah! Let's see who will be the lucky one this time!
Tutorial_200290,They are quite involved in the performance. I'm a little bit nervous now.
Tutorial_200291,"Waaaaaah! Captain Cosmos, do you think this is over?!"
Tutorial_200292,Of course! You have no way to escape now!
Tutorial_200293,You will not have a chance to commit sins on other planets!

Tutorial_200301,This is real! Is all this real?! Are they crazy or me?! I helped a superhero kill an evil alien doctor?!
Tutorial_200302,Maybe it's me that needs to see the doctor.

世界boss触发教学,
Tutorial_200317,STOP! Overseer! Keep some distance from that giant monster! What you just found is the king of the monsters in this area!
Tutorial_200318,"It dominates this irradiated area, so you must be prepared to destroy it. Only when you are ready can you challenge. You can find it in the right column of the main map."
Tutorial_200319,"Of course, if you can eliminate this big creature, then you can definitely get the goodies left by countless poor souls."
Tutorial_200320,"This monster is quite cunning, it will only stay in one place for a while, then it will escape, next time there is no way to find it."
Tutorial_200321,"If you find it difficult to challenge it all by yourself, then you can also tell the other overseers around you. I'm sure others will be willing to come over for the sake of the loot."
Tutorial_200322,"So, Go fight, we should be the only dominators in the whole Wasteland!"
刀锋二期联动,
Tutorial_200323,Saashi! Saashi! We've got a question!
Tutorial_200324,Oh? What is it about?
Tutorial_200325,The cave we found in Mabel Mountain before did not teleport back with the mountain. Wasn't you that told us to seal it?
Tutorial_200326,"Yes, it is unstable. I'm not sure what will happen. Don't approach it until there is a method to teleport that cave back......You did something on it, didn't you? !"
Tutorial_200327,What are you talking about? How can we touch something we are not familiar with?
Tutorial_200328,That's good. There won't have any problems as long as you didn't touch anything.
Tutorial_200329,Um......We......we just took something up for the scientific investigation......
Tutorial_200330,So you guys got in anyway! !
Tutorial_200331,It's not important! The important thing is……where the dragon is hiding.
Tutorial_200332,"Dragons don't like this place, they like to live on the mountain tops but not in a cave......"
Tutorial_200333,What's the matter with this dragon that's willing to follow us back and that bunch of green monsters chasing us?
Tutorial_200334,? ? ? You have made Saashi confused.
Tutorial_200335,"! ! ! ! ""Ow-wooo""! ! ! !"
Tutorial_200336,Hold on! What you say? You mean you escaped here? There are many goblins in the caves?
Tutorial_200337,O my great Marcel and Secunda!  Surprised that there is actually a dragon that can communicate with Khajiit!
Tutorial_200338,"! ! ! ! ""Ow-wooo""! ! ! !"
Tutorial_200339,You mean you want to go back over there? What a coincidence that Khajiit wanted the same thing.
Tutorial_200340,"! ! ! ! ""Ow-wooo""! ! ! !"
Tutorial_200341,What? ! Are you saying you've seen magic signs in the caves? There may also be a teleportation portal!
Tutorial_200342,Go! Go to the caves to find a method back home!
Tutorial_200343,What's this? Is this the goblin's vault of treasures and weapons?
Tutorial_200344,"Well, it looks like the goblins don't need them, either."
Tutorial_200345,But don't sabotage it too hard! Put that bomb down!
Tutorial_200346,"If Khajiit's correct, then this metal seal should be used together with the magic tablet."
Tutorial_200347,"It's like that, the magic tablet is a kettle, the metal engraving is a cup, you need to pour the water from the kettle into the cup before drinking it."
Tutorial_200348,"It is strange, yet it can strengthen the goblins......If it can strengthen the goblins, it may also strengthen our dragons."
Tutorial_200349,"There is a magic sign at the end of this path, so there might be a magic tablet we need. We need a magic tablet to test it out, it would be great if we can strengthen our dragon."
Tutorial_200350,As expected! These magic tablets are the source of the goblin's great power!
Tutorial_200351,They must work for our dragon though we don't where they came from!
Tutorial_200352,Khajiit's disappointed! Didn't expect this teleportation portal was not available! Does that mean we have to continue living here again?
Tutorial_200353,"Yes, we have to."
Tutorial_200354,"""Ow-wooo""! Hoo-hoo! !"
Tutorial_200355,What is that? You have restored your memory? !
Tutorial_200356,You saw a lot of ghouls and a black-robed wizard? Did he imprison you here? !
Tutorial_200357,Geez! Where did the ghouls come from? Could it be that the original mistake led to the teleportation of more than just Mount Mabel?
Tutorial_200358,"""Ow-wooo""! !"
Tutorial_200359,"How come you broke the crags……Wait, it's actually……a grave? !"
Tutorial_200360,"Geez, so many of graves, what a spectacle ever! This is a pattern that has never been seen before. Is it some civilization that Khajiit never knew about?"
Tutorial_200361,Hold on! This grave is actually open! Saashi has to return to the Base and tell everyone about it! A large group of ghouls and a wizard escaped!
Tutorial_200362,Glad you're here. The show is on. Hope you like it (laughter).
Tutorial_200363,"Get up, guys! It's time for another show, strangers! I've prepared another show for you, yet I don't know if you'll ever get out of this theater (laughter)"
Tutorial_200364,"Don't you fools know what a good timing is? Well, well, then I'll have to perform it again (laughter)"

Action_GlowingSea_1000001,"<playername>, we received a message from our radio station. This message is quite special, because it's a...um...a very special mission."
Action_GlowingSea_1000002,"Let me give you some of the details, someone wants us to find a friend of his. According to his words, his friend went to the Glowing Sea for some unknown reason, and hasn't returned."
Action_GlowingSea_1000003,"And his friend's health has some problems...anyway, you get the idea, this is a pretty complicated mission."
Action_GlowingSea_1000004,"This is not rubbish! This is a silver souvenir coin, it's said that a lot of travelling merchants like collecting these, I think merchants in the Glowing Sea will trade for this too."
Action_GlowingSea_1000005,"Given the difficulty of this mission, I called for some backup!"
Action_GlowingSea_1000006,"When you're ready, let's choose a destination and head out. That backup I mentioned is probably waiting."
Action_GlowingSea_1000007,"Hello! My name is Nick Valentine, I'm a detective or a 'Private Eye'. I'm guessing you're from a Vault?"
Action_GlowingSea_1000008,Yes Detective Valentine! I'm very glad that you've come to help us. Who is this? You've brought some of your own backup?
Action_GlowingSea_1000009,"Ah, yes. Given that we'll be searching in the Glowing Sea, I thought we would need some extra help, let me make the introductions."
Action_GlowingSea_1000010,"This is Madison Li, she has conducted research on the Glowing Sea, she probably knows this place better than any of us."
Action_GlowingSea_1000011,"Hi everyone! I came here for my own research, but I trust that we can all work well together."
Action_GlowingSea_1000012,"And this is Haylen, she really just wants to be a part of this mission and follow us into the Glowing Sea."
Action_GlowingSea_1000013,"Hello! There may be some cool pre-war technology in the Glowing Sea, I want to go look for them. And of course, if I can be of any assistance to your mission then I will try my best."
Action_GlowingSea_1000014,"Great! With your help, our mission should be very successful!"
Action_GlowingSea_1000015,"Hm, strictly speaking, whether we will be successful or not depends on us being careful. The Glowing Sea is a dangerous place after all, look—"
Action_GlowingSea_1000016,"What lays before us is mostly unknown, we can only move around locations that have already been scouted."
Action_GlowingSea_1000017,"Yes, in a special area like this, we would have to pay Cola Tokens for every location we go to and every mission we take."
Action_GlowingSea_1000018,"That's right. So, if you're all ready, let's get started. There is something a little strange about the person we're looking for, I will explain everything on the way."
Action_GlowingSea_1000019,"No problem! Our team is ready, let's go."
Action_GlowingSea_1000020,Attention everyone! We are now in the Glowing Sea! This Rest Stop is safe enough for us to take a rest.
Action_GlowingSea_1000021,"But most importantly, our combat team can come here and change members."
Action_GlowingSea_1000022,"You should know, in the Glowing Sea, the combat team cannot be healed immediately like they can be back in the Vault. Damages built up from recent combats will have impact on later missions."
Action_GlowingSea_1000023,"So Rest Stops like this one are very valuable to us, we have 3 chances a day and don't need to pay any Cola Tokens. We should use it wisely."
Action_GlowingSea_1000024,"Watch out! Enemies! If we don't clear this point, we won't be able to move on."
Action_GlowingSea_1000025,"Yes, it doesn't look like I can scare him away. It's time for a battle!"
Action_GlowingSea_1000026,"What Madison Li said was right, we cannot recover here, the team's injuries and radiation levels will affect our next fight."
Action_GlowingSea_1000027,I suggest you use any combat tools you found.
Action_GlowingSea_1000028,"Hm...Haylen, what do you think this garbage is?"
Action_GlowingSea_1000029,"That would be a bit hard, these merchants only carry supply goods that can be used in the Glowing Sea, and they only refresh what they sell once a day, we can buy them according to our needs."
Action_GlowingSea_1000030,"But the products from the Glowing Sea traders are very useful to the Vault, they are worth purchasing."
Action_GlowingSea_1000031,"Hm......traders that come here are quite special, they are interested in the circuit board we just collected, we can only trade their goods with these circuit boards."
Action_GlowingSea_1000032,"Plus, these traders are all separate, Each has something different every time, this gives us more options."
Action_GlowingSea_1000033,"These traders gave us some very valuable intel—it's about another type of broken circuit board we collected, though the travelling merchants don't want them, but another trader is recycling them."
Action_GlowingSea_1000034,"I think it's because they can extract some rare resources from them, so its trading value is very high. Look, this is the contact the travelling merchant gave me."
Action_GlowingSea_1000035,This looks pretty good! Let's collect more of these.
Action_GlowingSea_1000036,Great! Let's collect these souvenir coins! I want to buy everything the travelling merchant has.
Action_GlowingSea_1000037,"Um...I want these souvenir coins, I want to buy a lot of things too..."
Action_GlowingSea_1000038,"If the whole team has lost, you will need to let them rest to recover. Make good use of the 3 free rest chances."
Action_GlowingSea_1000039,"Be careful! I found the enemy's important defense point when I was scouting, its internal structure looks very complicated."
Action_GlowingSea_1000040,"According to my calculations and observations, these places cannot be cleared out all at once, we need to search each floor in stages."
Action_GlowingSea_1000041,"I'm very worried about an energy abnormality here, seems like it's an energy interference from some kind of transmission. I'm afraid there will be endless enemies here, I don't think we can control them completely."
Action_GlowingSea_1000042,"This is my analysis, you can search deeper according to your strength, maybe you will find something."
Action_GlowingSea_1000043,"Apart from this, I need to warn you, because of the Glowing Sea's horrific environment, the Combat Team's abilities will probably be limited to a certain level, and their equipment levels will be affected too."
Action_GlowingSea_1000044,"So, members with levels above that limitation cannot fully use their combat abilities."
Action_GlowingSea_1000045,"The good thing is, the combat member's ranking, equipment and team relationship will not be affected by this."
Action_GlowingSea_1000046,Hi Nick! We heard that there's huge amount of resource under the Glowing Sea.
Action_GlowingSea_1000047,Haylen's information is correct. We've found quite a few new things.
Action_GlowingSea_1000048,Let's walk around the Glowing Sea again.
Action_GlowingSea_1000049,Let's go. Just like taking a vacation. The Glowing Sea is a sea after all although this green scene makes me throw up.
Action_GlowingSea_1000050,I think this Glowing Sea journey is weird
Action_GlowingSea_1000051,Why?
Action_GlowingSea_1000052,"Here, bullets. Obviously the Raiders also came here."
Action_GlowingSea_1000053,Interesting. Then we are facing the double threat from radiated monsters and also Raiders?
Action_GlowingSea_1000054,We can handle it. It's just we need to be more careful.
Action_Quincy_1000001,"<playername>, Preston sent a message, he said he will be going to Quincy to check on the Gunner's' situation, and he needs our assistance."
Action_Quincy_1000002,Perhaps the hate between the Minutemen and Gunners will be ending soon.
Action_Quincy_1000003,Let's go to Quincy and meet up with Preston.
Action_Quincy_1000004,"We're here, this is the outskirts of Quincy, Preston should be meeting us here."
Action_Quincy_1000005,You're here.
Action_Quincy_1000006,"Ah, Preston, great, looks like we're all punctual."
Action_Quincy_1000007,"We will be entering Quincy secretly to get the Gunners' intel. I'm pretty familiar with Quincy, so I'll be leading the way. To keep a low profile and not alert the Gunners, I didn't bring anyone else."
Action_Quincy_1000008,Ohh...but what's up with these two Railroad guys?
Action_Quincy_1000009,"Hi! We're here to help Preston find the Gunners' intel, we are experienced agents from the Railroad after all."
Action_Quincy_1000010,......
Action_Quincy_1000011,Us 'Railroad guys' you're talking about are much more helpful than Preston's men? Right Glory?
Action_Quincy_1000012,"I think we have more important things to do, like liberating the Synths..."
Action_Quincy_1000013,"Yes, but Desdemona has sent us on this mission for us to help. This needs to be taken seriously too."
Action_Quincy_1000014,......
Action_Quincy_1000015,"Come on! Just see it as a field experience or professional training, it'll be fun! I can't wait."
Action_Quincy_1000016,"So that's it, we can start now, be careful everyone."
Action_Quincy_1000017,What the...
Action_Quincy_1000018,"We built a communication station that can be used for contacting others, over here, we can recruit some very good helpers with silver souvenir coins."
Action_Quincy_1000019,"These recruited helpers will be ready in 24 hours, they can be chosen as a member of the combat team in the Quincy area. We will be building more contacting points as we explore more."

Chapter_Des_100,"I was chosen by the Command System as a candidate for the Overseer of this Vault, which is a huge honor and responsibility, but clearly someone is unhappy with this decision and is making it harder for me."
Chapter_Des_101,"After a tremendous disaster, the Overseer is gone, the Resource Purifier was lost, and the Vault door that had been sealed for 200 years has finally opened. The Vault is in complete chaos without a leader, so they asked me, an Overseer in training of just one day, to take the lead as their only option..."
Chapter_Des_102,"The Wasteland is not as dead as we imagined. Despite the mess, violence and hard life, people are already struggling to restore order. Perhaps we can survive without the Resource Purifier..."
Chapter_Des_103,"As the exploration goes deeper into the Wasteland, we've met more enemies, as well as more friends – friends for now, at least. But the trail of the Ex-Overseer is still vague and confusing..."
Chapter_Des_104,"We finally made it to the Boston area, which is practically the center of the Commonwealth. We've met more people here, and witnessed more things..."
Chapter_Des_105,I don't know what we may encounter while searching for the Ex-Overseer on the Commonwealth Wasteland. All I know is that anything could happen to different people under different choices...
Chapter_Des_106,"Our search for the Ex-Overseer still has uncovered many dangers, especially those hidden deep underground. However, hope to find the Ex-Overseer by working with other factions."
Chapter_Des_107,"Even if we have made contact with all forces in the Commonwealth and established a seemingly good friendship with them, we must remember our top priority is to find the Ex-Overseer and Resource Purifier."
Chapter_Des_108,"The ex-Overseer's whereabouts are still cause for worry. Every time we think we're getting close, we discover that we are further away from him......everything depends on us retrieving the Purifier."
Chapter_Des_109,"Luckily, we've got everything Nick asked us to find, now we just need to wait patiently. When Nick finishes the tracker we should find our ex-Overseer."
Chapter_Des_110,"We walked out of the Vault because of our ex-Overseer, up until now, our footprints are all over the Boston area. Nick said we will be reaching the end result soon. I hope everything will work out alright in the end."
Chapter_Des_111,"The last place we will be going is the Glowing Sea. The old Overseer is there. Hopefully we can bring him back to the Vault. This warm, peaceful, and strong Vault."
Chapter_Des_112,"Overseer Jacob destroyed the Resource Purifier and along with it, the scheme devised by Vault-Tech for over two hundred years. We won't forget his sacrifice. But we have a new goal, to seek a cure for FEV."
Chapter_Des_113,"The Capital Wasteland is a strange and dangerous place where we've encountered many a plight since our arrival. New enemies are extremely powerful. We don't know much about their origins, but we can sense a link between them and the FEV."
Chapter_Des_114,"The route leading to the Oasis is controlled by the slavers, the natural enemy of the abolitionists. Seems we must tread lightly if we'd like to pass this area."
Chapter_Des_115,"Oasis? A talking tree? Sounds crazy. But Hannibal's eyes look serious. Uneasy and disturbed, we're heading to the Oasis to the west. The Capital Wasteland is quite...elusive."
Chapter_Des_116,"Knowing the location of their base, now we can launch an assault at the Enclave. Next stop: Ravenrock!"
Chapter_Des_117,We barely escaped from the claw of Enclave but lost our way in Mount Mabel...
Chapter_Des_118,We saved a deathclaw who had been tormented by Enclave experiment. But we also displeased a wanderer. What awaits us next?
Chapter_Des_119,"With the help of ""Lyons Pride"", we made it into Vault 87. But we found a bunch of Talon mercenaries in this god-forsaken place! What are these sneaky guys up to?"
Chapter_Des_120,The Brotherhood has started to search for hidden Enclave bases. And we may take a break with the opportunity... Perhaps a vacation in the Capital Wasteland?

Dlg_010103,"You've done a good job so far. We'll have to start working on the food problem. After we have the food, we'll be able to get back to work."
Dlg_010105_1,"I've heard that there is a job for me here, but I also want to study the ecological environment of the Vault. If that's okay, you can count me in."
Dlg_010105_2,"Overseer, we need to provide Moira Brown with a place in the Vault. Please build a new or upgrade an existing LIVING QUARTERS to make more room for people to reside."
Dlg_010115_1,I thought there would be no one else along the way except the Raiders and I'd be able to provide technical assistance to your Vault for a while before I get back to the Institute.
Dlg_010115_2,"Dear Overseer, although Madison Li promised that she would help us build the Vault, there is no more living space. Please upgrade the LIVING QUARTERS first."
Dlg_010110,"Overseer, we must continue to explore the Wasteland in depth according to the need for materials of the Vault. We need to build a RADIO STUDIO first to do some investigation."
Dlg_010113,The enemies of Concord may be difficult for us to deal with. We must equip our dwellers with better weapons.
Dlg_010117,"I must say, these exercises are useful. At least I feel that I can work more efficiently."
Dlg_030101,"Dear Overseer, we need to upgrade our dweller's expertise in order to deal with more powerful enemies, but before that, we must improve the work efficiency of the Overseer's Office."
Dlg_030102,"Nice job, Overseer. We can build a shooting range to train the dweller's combat skills after we upgrade the Overseer's Office."
Dlg_040101,"Overseer, we are facing more threats with our expansion. We need to continue upgrading the gate to improve our defenses."
Dlg_101001_1,"I almost shot you, but seems you are not Raiders...did Preston send you here? Well, I thought he couldn't find any support."
Dlg_101001_2,"I intend to build an outpost here to meet some of the refugees that escaped from Quincy. But as you can see, we have to clear all these monsters first. Let's do it."
Dlg_101002,Thank you so much. I hope that more refugees can escape from the Triggermen... We have to kill those Raiders along the road to the Drumlin Diner.
Dlg_102001_1,"The Raiders will attack those refugees, and the more of those Raiders we kill, the safer those refugees will be."
Dlg_102001_2,"God knows why Concord has so many Raiders, but they are far less capable than the Triggermen. It's very easy for us to kill them."
Dlg_102002,I will continue to patrol here for a while. Here are your rewards. I don't need the Raiders equipment. You can take them as trophies.
Dlg_103001_1,"Emergency! We're trapped in the Museum of Freedom by the Raiders. Anyone who receives this message, help us please!"
Dlg_103001_2,I repeat! We need help! Our settlers have been besieged by the Raiders! Please help us finish them off!
Dlg_103002_1,"Thank you very much for your help. It looks safe here now. We are the Commonwealth Minutemen, and we aim to rebuild the Wasteland and protect settlers."
Dlg_103002_2,"We had a lot of people when we got here after the Quincy Massacre, but there are only a few left."
Dlg_103002_3,"Then we will stay here. If you help us acquire refugees from the Starlight Drive-In, I will pay you handsomely."
Dlg_104001_1,Full channel broadcast! A Deathclaw has entered Concord town. Everyone prepare for the fight!
Dlg_104001_2,"It seems that we have to join hands and fight for survival again. If you help us, we'll help your Vault in return."
Dlg_104001_3,I've arranged the roadblock and trapped the Deathclaw and other monsters in the Museum of Freedom. We'll have to finish it off quickly.
Dlg_104003,"We finally finished it. Thank you for your help. If you are willing to establish a cooperative relationship with the Minutemen, we could really use your help."
Dlg_105001_1,"That Deathclaw almost ruined the entire town. We were counting on the ruins to shelter some refugees, but now it seems that we have to go from the top."
Dlg_105001_2,"We hope to provide the refugees with shelter using the prewar material from Concord Workshop, but I'm not available at the moment. Sturges knows what to look for."
Dlg_105002,"We have some useful material inside, but we've had no time to clear the monsters here. I'll find what we need if you could clear those monsters."
Dlg_105003,"Thanks a lot for helping the Minutemen. Now this place is safe. As a reward, our people are at your disposal. The reestablishment of the Wasteland requires everyone's devotion."
Dlg_106001,"Ronnie Shaw, soldier from Minutemen, at your service. I think we have met before. I will help you construct your Vault and deal with Raiders."
Dlg_107001_1,We've received a message for help sent from Thicket Excavation Site. The settlers there suffer from the threat of Mirelurks.
Dlg_107001_2,"Clearing these Mirelurks is a win-win situation. The settlement will be able to reestablish, while you receive quarrying equipment to construct your Vault."
Dlg_107002,"Great, I thought you wouldn't come. These Mirelurks are extremely troublesome, and I need your help to finish them off."
Dlg_107003,Thanks a lot. Just leave the rest to us. You will get the reward you deserve.
Dlg_108001_1,"According to the information from the crashed helicopter at the Museum of Freedom, there is an abandoned Air Force Satellite Station that is now occupied by a group of Raiders."
Dlg_108001_2,"If you are willing to clear those Raiders, you'll get the reward. You can also take all the material left in the satellite station. I must ensure the safety of Concord settlers."
Dlg_109001_1,The information from satellite station mentioned a place called Robotics Disposal Ground. That's where you'll be able to find the robots and electronic chips you need.
Dlg_109001_2,"If you clear the uncontrolled robots there, you'll get the reward from me and get material from the Robotics Disposal Ground."
Dlg_109002_1,Thank you so much for what you've done for us. I will contact you the first time when we need your help.
Dlg_109002_2,Please let us know if you are in trouble. We will try our best to help you.
Dlg_201001,"We've received our first plea for help from settlers. Settlers from Belford need help. If we help them, we will gain their support."
Dlg_201002,You're the Minutemen coming to help? I thought you were urban legends. We could really use your help clearing those ugly and crazy Ghouls.
Dlg_201003,"Finally! What a relief. We've still got much to do though. Since you're here, please help us out."
Dlg_202001,"We have to pass through Belford Station on the way to Concord, but it's occupied by a group of Ghouls. Please help me clear them."
Dlg_202002,You've finished them off? Incredible! I didn't think you could do it.
Dlg_203001,"You have done pretty much all we've asked, but we won't be safe until the Ghouls in National Cemetery are cleared off. Please eradicate them."
Dlg_203002_1,It stinks in here! Why didn't we bring gas masks?!
Dlg_203002_2,"Can't you be quiet? These Ghouls are sleeping. We kill them one by one, and then we get back. It won't take long."
Dlg_203003,"It's finally over. Anyone injured? It was a tough fight, but we made it."
Dlg_203004,"We thought you were just bragging, but you really helped us out. A deal is a deal, we'll join the Minutemen."
Dlg_204001_1,"A considerable amount of prewar material, which is of great strategic importance to us, is still in the Lexington Super Duper Mart."
Dlg_204001_2,"If you can clear the security robots there, we'll split the materials equally with you and give you some extra rewards."
Dlg_204002,"On the route the Minutemen took to retreat to Concord, we lost some companions due to the short rest we took."
Dlg_204003,"The past is the past. We've collected lots useful materials. People cannot always live in the past, they should look forward, right?"
Dlg_205001_1,We plan to eliminate the Raiders in the Corvega Assembly Plant. They will be a problem if you wanna explore further into the south of the Commonwealth.
Dlg_205001_2,"If we work together to clear them off', you would be able to have a safer trip to the south of the Commonwealth, and we would be able to ensure the safety of settlers in Lexington."
Dlg_205001_3,The first step of my plan is to clear the monsters in Lexington Apartments. We want to use it as an outpost for preparations of future attacks.
Dlg_205002,Looks like the plan is proceeding smoothly--darn it! Our members in the Super Duper Mart are being attacked by Ghouls!
Dlg_206001,They caused us lots of trouble before. We are not letting that happen again. Fire!
Dlg_206002,"We've finally finished. Sturges will prepare for the fortifications and combat, and then we'll going to confront the Raiders from Corvega."
Dlg_207001_1,Raiders from Corvega Assembly Plant are a great threat to settlers in Lexington and in most of northern areas. It's time to finish them off.
Dlg_207001_2,"With their base in the Corvega Assembly Plant, these Raiders are constantly expanding their sphere of influence. We couldn't clear them on our own. You have to join forces with us."
Dlg_207001_3,Are you ready for the clearing? The Minutemen armies are standing by. We'll attack as soon as your armies are ready.
Dlg_207002_1,The Minutemen? You're falling right into our hands. Looks like the Gunners from Quincy did not kill you. Fine. I don't mind teaching you another lesson!
Dlg_207002_2,Get ready to fight! It'll be a tough battle. Everyone has to go all out!
Dlg_207002_3,The Machines here are in better condition than I thought. I dare say that I can repair them all if we can take this place!
Dlg_207002_4,"None of you will leave here alive! I will eliminate every single one of you today! You just couldn't mind your own business, could you?"
Dlg_207003_1,"Thanks a lot for your help, it was a good win. The safety of the settlers in northeast Commonwealth Wasteland is ensured, and a hidden ours has been snuffed out."
Dlg_207003_2,"Our next task is to start reestablishing Lexington area. It takes time, but we have a head start."
Dlg_208001_1,We've found a settlement that has great potential. We'll be able to recruit settlers for construction if you could clear the Ghouls in there.
Dlg_208001_2,"The remaining buildings there are fairly complete, with some relatively more fertile soil. It's suitable for reestablishing anyway you look at it."
Dlg_208002_1,"We did the same thing before the collapse of the Minutemen. Looking for settlements, clearing monsters, and recruiting settlers."
Dlg_208002_2,"For many, this way of reestablishing Wasteland is inefficient. However, this is the most effective way in my opinion."
Dlg_208002_3,"Many people dream of restoring the world to the prewar condition, but how could this be possible? All we can do is to take it one step at a time."
Dlg_208003_1,"Next, I will build a RADIO STUDIO here and recruit settlers. Soon, this place will be an appropriate settlement."
Dlg_208003_2,But this is not the end. The newly-established settlement is extremely vulnerable. We need to build an outpost to protect settlers.
Dlg_209001,What we need to do is to clear the monsters in this church. The Minutemen will then build an outpost here so we can monitor the trends in the south and protect our settlers.
Dlg_209002_1,"Church...we had one when we were still in Quincy. It was Sturges' workshop at that time, where he had tried to repair a Power Armor."
Dlg_209002_2,"We suffered great losses at that time, and Sturges could not repair it even when the Gunners came around."
Dlg_209002_3,"All right, maybe I've been talking too much. Get ready to fight, we're not taking a walk here. Ghouls could attack at any time."
Dlg_209003,"It takes time to clear Lexington and build settlement, but we'll give you a hand."
Dlg_301001_1,Help! We are the Commonwealth reconnaissance squad of the Brotherhood of Steel. We've been attacked by Feral Ghouls in the Cambridge area.
Dlg_301001_2,"Repeat, we have been attacked by a large number of Feral Ghouls in the Cambridge area. Requesting any armed units to support us!"
Dlg_301002,"Armed civilians, we are the the Commonwealth reconnaissance squad of the Brotherhood of Steel. We have been attacked by Feral Ghouls and we need your help!"
Dlg_301003,"Thank you for your help, but we need your help with something else as well. Knight Ries will give you the details."
Dlg_302001_1,"I don't trust you Wasteland people, but I'll explain the task at hand. Listen carefully, I'm not going to repeat myself."
Dlg_302001_2,"Someone on our team was injured in the attack, and our medical supplies are scarce. I need you to go to the hospital building to bring back some Chems."
Dlg_302002_1,I will come with you. We must be careful the pre-war hospital is full of dangerous enemies.
Dlg_302002_2,When your team is searching I'll cover you. Accomplishing the task is the first priority
Dlg_302003,"Well, we've got the medicine we need. It's time to return to the camp."
Dlg_302004,Helen has another job for you.
Dlg_303001_1,I've investigated and found that there are pre-war prototype parts in the Material Institute. Please go there and recycle them.
Dlg_303001_2,"Please try to keep the system intact during the recycling process. If you find any useful devices, please bring them back."
Dlg_303002_1,I'll help you out so you don't damage any valuable pre-war technology. You may not understand the importance of these things to us.
Dlg_303002_2,"The more pre-war technology gathered, the stronger the Brotherhood of Steel will. If the technology is taken away by bad people, it can cause a disaster."
Dlg_303003,"Thank you very much for bringing back these things for us. Knight Ries will continue to assign you tasks. Of course, he will pay you for your services."
Dlg_304001_1,I believe you have seen many mutant creatures during your adventures - those monsters are malicious to human beings for no reason.
Dlg_304001_2,"So, I need you to destroy the monsters in the university ruins. It's for our safety."
Dlg_304002,"Ah, well done. Helen discovered something new while you were dealing with the monsters. You need to talk to her immediately."
Dlg_305001_1,"Thank you for your help. I'm sorry he spoke to you like that, but Knight Ries is always been that way. He's not doing this on purpose."
Dlg_305001_2,"Anyway, I found a map of the Material Institute in what you brought back, and we only explored a fraction of it."
Dlg_305001_3,"If you can continue to explore, then we will get more supplies and technology that people have forgotten."
Dlg_305002_1,"You brought back a lot of things, but I need to analyze and extract more useful information."
Dlg_305002_2,"During the time it took to do my analyses, Danse planned to destroy the Feral Ghoul that had been threatening us. He'd like to speak with you."
Dlg_306001_1,There you are. I plan to thoroughly wipe out the Feral Ghouls in the Cambridge area to keep us safe and to continue our Quest.
Dlg_306001_2,You can not accomplish this task alone. I will assist you in your battle.
Dlg_306002_1,"When we had just arrived in the Cambridge area, we had a bloody battle and had to return to the Cambridge Police Station."
Dlg_306002_2,There are still a huge amount of monsters here. So you better be prepared.
Dlg_306003,I didn't think you'd be so successful. You can go get your reward from Knight Ries. It is well-deserved.
Dlg_306004,I underestimated you. You have great potential. Danse has a very important task waiting for you.
Dlg_307001_1,I admire your abilities. I've officially recruited you to join the Brotherhood of Steel.
Dlg_307001_2,"The Brotherhood of Steel is committed to collecting pre-war technologies, eradicating monsters, protecting residents, and rebuilding civilizations. We've travelled all the way from the Wasteland in Washington."
Dlg_307001_3,"Our goal is to spy on the Commonwealth and collect technology, but our communications system is damaged. We need to find low-frequency transmitters to repair it."
Dlg_307001_4,They are located in a pre-war building called the arc jet system. We need to go deep inside and search. I am sure you understand.
Dlg_307002_1,"Before the war, mankind caused the destruction of the world because of the abuse of technology. We will not make such mistake. We will ensure that this technology will be used responsibly."
Dlg_307002_2,"It seems that the Institute has done it before us. These Synthetic human beings represent dangerous technology, and we can not allow them to ruin the world again."
Dlg_307002_3,"Wipe out the enemies here, then we'll be able to find... or take back our low-frequency transmitters."
Dlg_307003_1,"Good job! As a freshman of the Brotherhood of Steel, your performance was very good. Now, disband!"
Dlg_307003_2,"Before we go to the next area, Helen wants you to help her thoroughly explore the Material Institute. If you're busy, help her out."
Dlg_308001_1,"Based on the information we have obtained, underneath the Material Institute was the experimental center of the pre-war armed forces. I need to go there to bring back all the pre-war technologies."
Dlg_308001_2,Danse won't be able to go with you because he has to defend the camp. You'll be completely on your own. Take care of yourself.
Dlg_308002_1,"Thank you so much for helping me. Without your help, I wouldn't be able to recycle these things."
Dlg_308002_2,Go find Danse. This task is over and we can take a break.
Dlg_308002_3,"So far you have done very well, so the Brotherhood of Steel will help you to establish a safe Vault on the Commonwealth Wasteland."
Dlg_401001_1,"With the stability of Concord and Lexington, we need to continue to increase the impact of the Minutemen in the Commonwealth Wasteland."
Dlg_401001_2,We need to go to the Back Bay area to conduct reconnaissance and expel the riders in the wilderness of the northern part of the Back Bay and obtain the support of local settlers.
Dlg_401002,"If not for your timely arrival, I would have been killed by the Raiders. You are the Minutemen. Our Vault really need your help."
Dlg_402001_1,"You are also the Overseer of the Vault? Well, it's great to finally see the second Vault that is still running on the Wasteland."
Dlg_402001_2,"If you are here to help, then I won't beat around the bush. There are Mole Rats everywhere in our Vault and we do not have enough power to destroy them."
Dlg_402002,"In order to prevent loss of personnel, I have temporarily evacuated all dwellers outside the Vault. That way, you can use fire."
Dlg_402003,"The source is inside... Sure enough, the thing I was worried about came out. I'm afraid you'll have to help us for a while."
Dlg_403001_1,"That was the first generation of Overseers, and the Vault was originally designed to conduct an artificial medical experiment where all dwellers were scientists experiments."
Dlg_403001_2,"For the safety of Dwellers, the first generation of Overseers had managed to stop the original plan of Vault-Tech. But this has led to another issue."
Dlg_403001_3,"The rats that were originally shipped as a medical experiment did not starve to death because of the closure. Instead, they mutated and became our hidden dangers. I hope you can help us wipe them out."
Dlg_403002,Thank you for your help. Now we can sleep. I still have some problems here. I'll pay you if you're willing to help.
Dlg_404001_1,"The drainage of this Vault was linked to a pre-war sewer, but now it seems to have broken down, causing problems with the water supply in the shelter."
Dlg_404001_2,"If you can go in and find out where the problem it, we can send someone to repair it."
Dlg_404001_3,The sewer also contains some of the building materials and rubbish left before the war. You can take whatever you need.
Dlg_404002_1,"Oh, I should remind you that there will probably be some monsters since no one has been there for a long time."
Dlg_404002_2,"I'll send people to destroy them later, but now I advise you to avoid them."
Dlg_404003,"Well, it seems like the problem is on the inside, but thanks for your help."
Dlg_404004,"Our people will not forget what you have done. Of course, I will give you the necessary supplies and materials for the construction of the Vault and help you to carry out the work."
Dlg_405001_1,We received a request from the Diamond City caravan. There's a group of Raiders on the road from the north to Diamond City harassing the travelers in the ruins of the clothing store.
Dlg_405001_2,I know you may go to Diamond City to purchase supplies. Maybe you can wipe them out on your way and then go to Diamond City to receive your reward.
Dlg_405002,"Thank you very much! If you need more supplies or work, Diamond City has it!"
Dlg_406001,"Variants in public libraries have always been a threat to us, and I can't spare any security power from Diamond City to fight them. If you can kill them, I will pay you."
Dlg_406002,"You killed them? Well, it seems I underestimated you, but it's not over yet."
Dlg_407001_1,"You should know that managing and building a town is difficult. Right now, we need paint for rust proofing and coloring."
Dlg_407001_2,"We used to buy the goods from the Bunker Hill, but now they are out of stock, so we had to think of another way."
Dlg_407001_3,There should be some paint in the ruins of the hardware store in the south side of Diamond City. Kill the Raiders and bring the paint back.
Dlg_407002,Well done. Thank you for helping Diamond city. Here's your reward.
Dlg_408001,"Nick Valentine needs someone to assist him going to the police branch... I still owe him a favor. If you're willing to help, I will give you the commissions that he would have promised."
Dlg_408002_1,"I have one thing to do. The name of Nick Valentine, his memory, all of that man's life, was ruined by a guy named Eddie Winter."
Dlg_408002_2,"Before the war, Eddie Winter was a prolific criminal, but now he's nothing but a Ghoul hiding in a corner of the Commonwealth."
Dlg_408002_3,"If I could find a file about him here, then I might be able to track him down- oh no, the Feral Ghouls found us!"
Dlg_408003,Well done! We almost came out unscathed. These are only some of the files. I will continue to search the rest of them.
Dlg_409001_1,"Here comes more trouble. I need you to go to the Boston Library to find some pre-war books. Our settlers got a motor, but we couldn't fix it."
Dlg_409001_2,"If you can go to the public library to find the relevant instruction books, I'll reward you."
Dlg_409001_3,You brought back exactly what we needed. I think they will be able to fix that stuff soon. Here's your reward. It's well-deserved.
Dlg_409002,Welcome to Diamond City! Now enjoy the beauty of it.

historyname_020001,Minutemen
historytype_020001,History
historystory_020001,"\n The Minutemen were originally a loose militia founded by various settler communities on the Commonwealth Wasteland to protect themselves against the numerous threats and harassment present within the Commonwealth. The scale of armament expanded as more members joined. They first gained recognition among the Commonwealth after successfully defending Diamond City from a Super Mutant attack in 2180.\n Then, the organization assumed control of Fort Independence in Boston, transforming it into their main base of operations and renamed it ""The Castle."" They erected a large radio tower in the courtyard of The Castle to direct the Minutemen all over the Commonwealth to help the civilian settlements in need without delay.\n However, in 2247, the Minutemen were forced to abandon the fort when a Mirelurk Queen was assaulting the Castle with the intent to nest in it. Thinking it was a Super Mutant beast attack, the leader General McGann started the security system and locked himself deep into the armory to protect the armory from being entered by the Super Mutants. Finally, he died by dehydration as a result of consuming a fair amount of wine and the Minutemen had to abandon the Castle accordingly.\n The last general of the Minutemen, General Becker, was killed in 2282. Upon his death, the Minutemen began to experience internal strife, as the various groups couldn't agree upon a successor. The loss of the Castle only exacerbated the problem. The whole Minutemen faction nearly fell apart following the Quincy Massacre after 2287, and most of the group disbanded in disgust or turned to looting, following the loss of their supporters.\n Now the Minutemen had almost ceased to exist as a group except for Preston and the survivors under him, but Preston still expects to reconstruct the organization!"
historyname_040001,Brotherhood of Steel
historytype_040001,History
historystory_040001,"\n The East Coast Brotherhood of Steel was developed from an expedition to Washington, D.C. by the central Brotherhood of Steel in 2254. Their headquarters is in the ruins of the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. The team was led by Elder Owyn Lyons who was dedicated to maintaining the security of the settlers in the Capital Wasteland, rather than purely recycling and possessing pre-war technology.\n The change of goals led to the detachment between Elder Owyn Lyons and the headquarters of the Brotherhood of Steel, following the loss of support from the Lost Hills. Meanwhile, some members under Elder Owyn from the east also chose to serve the original philosophy of the organization and broke ties with him to form the Outcasts.\n The Brotherhood finally gained steady troops and logistical support after helping the Sole Survivor with Project Purity and eliminating the Enclave in the Capital Wasteland in 2277. Lyons passed away not long after and his daughter Sarah Lyons was killed in combat. Arthur Maxson assumed the elder position of the East Coast Brotherhood of Steel, as he was the last descendant of the Brotherhood founder Roger Maxson, a move which was approved by the Lost Hills.\n After his appointment, Arthur Maxson combined both ideas from Elder Lyons and the original Brotherhood, which was to protect the humans while attaching importance to technology occupation and preservation. He defeated the Super Mutants and raiders in the Capital Wasteland and brokered peace with the Brotherhood Outcasts. He then sent expeditions to explore in the Commonwealth Wasteland."
historyname_050001,Diamond City
historytype_050001,History
historystory_050001,"\n Diamond City was transformed from Fenway Park in 2130 and quickly attracted many settlers all over the Commonwealth Wasteland, then established itself as the most prosperous community on the Commonwealth Wasteland. Settlers strove to earn a living, so the community developed a degree of social stratification as wealthier residents mostly came to occupy properties in the upper stands. \n In 2180, the Commonwealth Minutemen defended the city from an attacking horde of Super Mutants. This caused the faction's eventual rise to fame.\n The ""Broken Mask Massacre"" occurred in 2229, when a traveler calling himself Mr. Carter suddenly shot in the Diamond City Bar killing several residents and securities. When security personnel killed Mr. Carter, they were frightened to discovered that he was a Synth.\n In 2272, the protectron Takahashi came to Diamond City to cook noodles in the old bloodbath bar. Thereafter noodles became one of the main cuisine items of Diamond City.\n McDonough was selected as Diamond City's mayor in 2282 who enacted the decree to expel Ghouls from the city. These Ghouls mostly relocated to Goodneighbor. Though the residents held a grudge against the decree, no one did anything essential to reverse it. \n Now a prosperous trade and environment still remains in Diamond City, but people's fear of Synths replacing humans keeps growing. The suspicion was exacerbated by Piper's newspaper Publick Occurrences. Although people are not big on keeping their hospitality with the threats of Synths and Super Mutants always haunting, the city is still developing in full swing."

historytype_060001,History
historystory_060001,"\n The primary aim of the Railroad is freeing Synths because they firmly believe Synths have the same rights of equality and freedom as humans.\n The conflict caused by this purpose between the Railroad and the Institute had lasted decades in Boston, during when the Railroad was devastated by the Institute for several times. But not after long, the Railroad recovered from its ruins with obstinacy and continued to contend with the Institute by helping Synths run away from the slavery of the Institute.\n Even though the Railroad was always the underdog in the past during the fight with the Institute, its leader often underestimated the enemy resulting in frequent crushing blows. After Desdemona assumed the new leadership, she changed the Railroad by paying more attention to intelligence and covert. The Railroad activities thus became more prudent and much safer.\n In 2281, the Railroad discovered a secret base of the old Office of National Intelligence and recycled a Predictive Analytic Machine or P.A.M. P.A.M. was installed with many pre-War technologies. He could analyze and present the desired result as long as inputting enough data. The machine ensured the Railroad more security when saving the Synths and allowed it to be a real threat to the Institute."
historyname_070001,Institute
historytype_070001,History
historystory_070001,"\n The Institute was founded by the survived researchers from the Commonwealth Institute of Technology whose purpose was to further pre-War science. So in its early days, the Institute built the very first Generation 1 Synths to aid the people of the Commonwealth in rebuilding civilization. But due to the mutual mistrust, the Institute gave up the cooperation and isolated itself with the people of the Commonwealth. Therefore the Institute completed a work on the Molecular Relay, a teleportation device, to expand deeper underground and completely seal itself off from the outside.\n The Institute only focus on its own scientific research underground ever since. Whenever the Institute required materials that it could not produce itself, Generation 1 and 2 Synths were teleported to the surface to scavenge and clean anything that was in their way. These behaviors led to conflict between the Synths and the people of the surface, and instilled in a lasting prejudice and wariness against the Synths.\n By 2227, work on the third generation of Synths, who would be indistinguishable from genuine humans, was well underway. In the same year Conrad Kellogg was sent out to Vault 111 and returned with the infant Shaun, whose pristine DNA was used to finish the new generation Synths. In 2229, the Institute even started to send the almost technically mature Generation 3 Synths on the surface helping it take control of the outside world."

historystory_080001,"\nHarold perhaps is the most unique Wastelander you've ever seen. When the Apocalypse happened, he was just 5. At the age of 18, he mustered enough courage to leave the Vault and went out to explore the wasteland.\n Not long after he left his Vault, Harold became a merchant of considerable wealth. But soon his life of peace was soon destroyed.\nIn 2102, Harold and Richard Grey, a doctor from The Hub, created an expedition team to track down the origin of mutants. When they came to the notorious Mariposa Military Base, they were caught off guard by an auto-defense system. Harold and Richard tumbled to the very depths of the base only to find a dreadful secret: the FEV virus.\nHarold was the only one to make it out of the base, but he had been infected with FEV and became a hideous ghoul. Soon his horrible appearance ended his mercantile career. However, he made it to survive and became a true legend of wasteland with his ghoul body.\nHe has travelled with the Exiled and served as the mayor of Gecko. As his legend has it, the mutated sapling on his head kept growing bigger and bigger.\nHarold finally stopped resisting and at last he became one with the sapling, now rooted somewhere north to the Capital Wasteland. He is now a talking tree with many faithful followers. Perhaps you'll meet him in the Capital Wasteland and listen to his unbelievable tales of the past. The tree is truly a living legend."

herotalk_108007,So many things to do but not enough help...what should I do?
herotalk_108008,"Every city needs to be rebuilt. Residences, farms, water sources... the Vault is the most comfortable place."
herotalk_108009,"I can repair anything, as long as it isn't power armor."
herotalk_108010,"Okay, I want to say I don't like combat, but sometimes you don't have a choice."
herotalk_109001,Come on! Come on! We're about to reach the destination!
herotalk_109002,"Next time, we should bring back more electronic components. Many facilities in the Vault need to be upgraded."
herotalk_109003,"There are so many things in the Vault that need to be repaired, but we are always short of materials."
herotalk_110001,Strong is hungry! Strong wants meat!
herotalk_110002,"Strong doesn't like bad humans, but you are a good one, Strong like you."
herotalk_110003,A bad human is ahead. Strong will smash!
herotalk_111001,I'll kill whomever you want me to. It's no trouble to me.
herotalk_111002,"One employer after another, I am not someone you should trust."
herotalk_111003,My past? I don't have much to say. Some things should be forgotten.
herotalk_112001,"Settlement after settlement. I know it's rebuilding the Wasteland, but sometimes it's too boring."
herotalk_112002,"You ask me why I don't choose to be a Raider? Come on, what's the point of living with an empty belly?"
herotalk_112003,To be honest I don't like the Castle at all. There's nothing around but Mirelurks.
herotalk_112004,Keep your eyes open and take a look around. I don't want to be ambushed.
herotalk_112005,I used to serve under Colonel Hollis. The Minutemen at that time was totally different.
herotalk_112006,"I saw Preston's great efforts, that's the reason why I returned to the Minutemen."
herotalk_112007,I don't think helping will be any different from helping Preston.
herotalk_112008,"Despite all the hardships, I believe the Minutemen will have a bright future under Preston's leadership."
herotalk_112009,This is how we live in the Wasteland. You always have to fight against enemies coming out of nowhere.
herotalk_112010,"If you can deploy more people to the team, our adventure will become much easier."
herotalk_113001,Can you imagine? I grew up in a town full of kids.
herotalk_113002,"In the Capital Wasteland, a guy like you is going to be sent for experiment by the Enclave."
herotalk_113003,"I'm a mercenary now, but was a mayor for a long time."
herotalk_113004,"Boss...um, Overseer, can we have some days off?"
herotalk_113005,I think my job is pretty good. Far better than I imagined.
herotalk_113006,Gunners? They are just some bloodsucking jerks.
herotalk_113007,Maybe I can start a new life in your place here...maybe...
herotalk_113008,"If you worry about me bringing in Gunners, I'll leave your Vault, but please settle the wages first."
herotalk_114001,"Trying to survive is hard enough in this world, just like everything else."
herotalk_114002,A small problem like this is common for me.
herotalk_114003,I don't care. Let's give a lesson to these jerks and let them know what violence is.
herotalk_115001,You want to know how Synths regard families? It's a serious question.
herotalk_115002,When can you give me a lighter weapon instead? The minigun is so heavy...
herotalk_115003,Your Vault is not covert at all. It's so surprising that the Institute doesn't replace your settlers with Synths.
herotalk_115004,Can we just spend more time preparing better weapons...
herotalk_115005,I would consider starting a business once I'm no longer needed on the battlefield.
herotalk_115006,"If not, the Institute will try to control us, and I don't like combat."
herotalk_115007,Freeing Synths is an endless job. The Railroad and Desdemona have sacrificed a great deal.
herotalk_115008,"Compared to Deacon's work, I'm more suitable to fight in the front."
herotalk_115009,You ask me how it feels to be a Synth? I don't think it's any different than being a human.
herotalk_115010,"Most people think the existence of Synths is a sin, so we'll never be safe."
herotalk_116001,There are always people who don't want others to enjoy their lives. I can't stand people like that.
herotalk_116002,I hate these ruffians. They always have a reason to mess up others' lives.
herotalk_116003,I'm happy to see an organized Vault like this in the Wasteland.
herotalk_117001,I don't think humans and robots should be hostile towards each other.
herotalk_117002,I suggest you take a physical examination to prevent mutation.
herotalk_117003,What can Synths eat? Are their stomachs also Synthetic?
herotalk_117004,"According to the research, Vault Dwellers have a lower immunity to diseases."
herotalk_117005,"If you agree, I'd like to have a physical examination in your Vault."
herotalk_117006,I want to own a lab to continue my research on Vault 81.
herotalk_117007,The Wasteland is a mystery. I like this sense of uncertainty.
herotalk_118001,"If you come up with any undamaged pre-War tech, don't forget to remind me to recycle."
herotalk_118002,"Pre-War technology is great to have, but really difficult to repair."
herotalk_118003,"To tell the truth, I don't usually like this bureaucratic work process either..."
herotalk_119001,"Not all Vaults are like yours...if they were, many tragedies could be avoided."
herotalk_119002,"Science isn't a problem, but most people just care about what it can do for them personally..."
herotalk_119003,"Science isn't wrong, the problems lie in the people attempting to take advantage of it. Don't be cheated by them."
herotalk_120001,Helping people in the Commonwealth Wasteland is also helping yourself.
herotalk_120002,I think these places can all be taken over by the Minutemen as strongholds after clearing some of them up.
herotalk_120003,Reconstructing the Commonwealth is no doubt a challenge...I'm not saying you need to help every settlement.
herotalk_120004,There's always a settlement out there crying for our help. This is our duty.
herotalk_120005,"If the Castle is retrieved, the Minutemen will be able to help the Commonwealth settlers like before."
herotalk_120006,"Our weapons may be old, but any settler of the Wasteland can use them."
herotalk_120007,The Minutemen don't have a leader since General Becker was killed. It was a time of chaos and disaster.
herotalk_120008,"We could have brought more people out of Quincy, but we were being besieged and chased by the Raiders and Gunners."
herotalk_120009,Raiders have no morals or laws. We can't let them go.
herotalk_121001,I know you're tired. But keep yourself together! We got visitors.
herotalk_121002,I will prepare your defenses for you.
herotalk_121003,You ask me what if I was a Synth myself? Of course I would still serve the Brotherhood of Steel.
herotalk_121004,"As a qualified warrior, it is your duty to complete the organization's tasks."
herotalk_121005,"I've witnessed many brothers passing away. The more I see, the more I want to kill those evil monsters."
herotalk_121006,The Wasteland would be a much safer place without those guys abusing technology.
herotalk_121007,The Brotherhood of Steel is a reliable organization. I'm sure you'll understand.
herotalk_121008,I should apologize to you. We didn't get along well in the beginning.
herotalk_122001,This isn't the worst place I've been. I was trapped and surrounded by Ghouls...
herotalk_122002,"Keep your eyes open, friends. The last thing you want is to be ambushed."
herotalk_122003,Saving Synths isn't anything crazy. What's crazy is the atrocities caused by the fear of Synths.
herotalk_123001,I know my identity and my task. I have a clear understanding of myself.
herotalk_123002,"The Institute is mankind's only hope. Many people don't understand us, but one day they will."
herotalk_123003,"You've also seen what the Commonwealth is like now. No one can change it, except for the Institute."
herotalk_124001,You are too easy on your men. An organization must have a forceful leader.
herotalk_124002,The Brotherhood of Steel is helping you. I hope you can remember that.
herotalk_124003,The Institute and their dangerous inventions must be annihilated. No compromise!
herotalk_125001,I have no confidence in anything in the Wasteland. It like hell here.
herotalk_125002,I can hardly imagine how these barbarians survive. They live like animals.
herotalk_125003,Look what those self-claiming righteous organizations have done? They only care about their own selfish interests.
herotalk_126001,"Sometimes I wonder, how do people in power armor answer the call of nature in combat?"
herotalk_126002,You asking me why I don't wear power armor? You want me to do your surgery in power armor?
herotalk_126003,"Other than for protein, why should I eat the Radroach?"
herotalk_126004,It's dark and dirty here. I really don't know why you want to come here.
herotalk_126005,"We lack medicine, weapons, anything...we've wasted too much time."
herotalk_126006,Living in the Wasteland requires good health to prevent offspring from being polluted.
herotalk_126007,I don't want to see non-human stuff in your Vault.
herotalk_126008,Don't have high expectation for Wasteland settlers. Most of them don't know how to take care of themselves.
herotalk_126009,"Compared to your place, I'd rather work in Brotherhood of Steel."
herotalk_126010,"To be honest, I don't think I'm the right person for the expedition."
herotalk_127001,"As far as I can see, the Wasteland Survival Guide is applicable to most areas in America."
herotalk_127002,Maybe we can write another Wasteland Construction Guide? That's a huge project!
herotalk_127003,I've met many mutant creatures. I should keep track of them in the book.
herotalk_127004,Eat a raw Mirelurk? Why would you ask me that? I'd have be insane to do that.
herotalk_127005,"I've never planned for ""taming a Deathclaw."" Only the western Wasteland people can think of this kind of things."
herotalk_128001,"If you can help me solve my father's problem, I can give you some serum..."
herotalk_128002,Can you imagine how it would feel to live from the 18th century up until now? I know you can't.
herotalk_128003,"My father knows a lot, but unfortunately, he is a madman now. Not all knowledge is kind."
herotalk_129001,"If I have the time, I want to shoot a documentary in your Vault."
herotalk_129002,I think I should start publishing Vault Daily in your Vault.
herotalk_129003,There are a lot of people for me to interview in your Vault.
herotalk_129004,"If this was before the War, I would be a ""famous"" journalist."
herotalk_129005,"I don't think my interview has brought any trouble to Diamond City. Yep, it can't be otherwise."
herotalk_129006,"I don't like Synths, but I'll help report if they are in need of help."
herotalk_129007,News is important. Everyone must be informed on what's happening.
herotalk_130001,"I've dealt with many people during the investigation in the Wasteland, but obviously not monsters."
herotalk_130002,You're asking me to investigate what this place was used for before the War? That's a waste of time.
herotalk_130003,"Most of my investigations end in violence, which really doesn't make me look like a detective..."
herotalk_130004,"Compared with the more human-like 3rd generation Synths, not many of are afraid of it. ."
herotalk_130005,"I think you've been through many hardships, but everything's going to be fine."
herotalk_130006,"If you want to solve a case in the Vault, find me in the detective agency in Diamond City."
herotalk_130007,"I have trouble defining the word ""memory."""
herotalk_131001,I'm so happy to see Synths in your Vault. It's great that you're not prejudice against them.
herotalk_131002,"After clearing the enemies here, I'll set up a Railroad meeting place."
herotalk_131003,It's good that you understand Synths are free. Hopefully you won't change your mind.
herotalk_132001,(Dogmeat drools at you. He may think you look tasty.)
herotalk_132002,"(Dogmeat leisurely wags his tail, enjoying the short break.)"
herotalk_132003,(Dogmeat wags his tail and digs into the ground.)
herotalk_132004,(Dogmeat excitedly wags his tail. He seems to have found something interesting.)
herotalk_132005,(Dogmeat barks towards the front. He seems to be warning you.)
herotalk_132006,(Dogmeat tilts his head and looks around the area with curiosity.)
herotalk_133001,"If I could, I'd like to sing a song quietly..."
herotalk_133002,"When the work is over, I'll have a glass of wine and lay in bed to savor the taste of life..."
herotalk_133003,I wish there was someone here who could understand how I feel about this song...
herotalk_134001,At least the Vault operations are normal now.
herotalk_134002,The technology here can't even hold a candle to the Institute. There is barely any room for me to improve.
herotalk_134003,Work hard! Although your efforts in technology are measured in how much good they do.
herotalk_135001,Kazahla! Kazahla! Um humzah! Zah zahla!
herotalk_135002,(Alien looks at you ferociously and shakes his head with a grimace.)
herotalk_136001,"Hey! Me, Virgil, name. Me, human!"
herotalk_136002,"Vault, place, good. Institute, I, cannot find."
herotalk_136003,"FEV, mistake, huge! Shaun! Mistake! Huge!!"
herotalk_137001,I used to think that people who lived in a Vault for a long period of time could devolve into cavemen.
herotalk_137002,"This Vault gives me a little bit of hope. Emphasis on ""a little bit."""
herotalk_137003,"People can get desperate because of anguish, so I'm going to relieve their anguish."
herotalk_138001,Strict rules lead to well-ordered behavior mode. People carefully following the rules can produce to the greatest efficiency.
herotalk_138002,"Strictly speaking, some rules are missing in the Vault...of course, this is not an army."
herotalk_138003,"According to my observation, the worker training needs to be enhanced to ensure efficiency."
herotalk_139001,"This place is totally last decade...Look at these boring machines, they're just ..."
herotalk_139002,Can't you have find a cure for your boredom in work? Doesn't a fun environment pick up your mood?
herotalk_139003,So exhausting...so boring...so depressing...
herotalk_140001,"In my humble opinion, this work is so easy it's almost meaningless!"
herotalk_140002,"I should be killing enemies on the battlefield, not fiddling with these fragile machines."
herotalk_140003,"You're so brave. I admire your courage, but I still wish to shoot you full of the ol' Fat Man lead."
herotalk_141001,Come to play cards later?
herotalk_141002,"If you could choose anyone to come to your Vault, who would you choose?"
herotalk_141003,"Hey, did you hear what they said last night?"
herotalk_142001,Which mutant animal do you think is the most scary?
herotalk_142002,I want to have a big piece of steak for dinner. What about you?
herotalk_142003,I can feel the chilly air draft in here. Am I the only one?
herotalk_143001,"If you had a chance to visit a landmark in the outside world, what would you choose?"
herotalk_143002,"If you could leave the Vault and take any building as your new home, where would you choose?"
herotalk_143003,What if we dig so deep we hit magma?
herotalk_144001,"I need a screwdriver, do you have one?"
herotalk_144002,"I want to learn another language, what about you?"
herotalk_144003,How many Vaults do you think are out there?
herotalk_145001,"Want to play catch, later?"
herotalk_145002,What's new?
herotalk_145003,"I decided to write the new greatest novel of all time, about all of us!"
herotalk_146001,"Wow, I'm shivering right now! I've drunk too much caffeine!"
herotalk_146002,Did you smell anything strange?
herotalk_146003,Cheer up! The Overseer is watching us!
herotalk_147001,"Who will win the fight, a radscorpion or Yao Guai?"
herotalk_147002,"If I establish a Vault baseball team, would you join?"
herotalk_147003,I eat the same thing for every dinner—a can of pork n beans and iced Nuka-Cola.
herotalk_148001,"Yeah...Look, rather than a soldier, I'd prefer to be a lover."
herotalk_148002,"Ah, but I'm already able to fluently speak...the language of love."
herotalk_148003,"Baby, baby, baby, ohh...Baby, baby, baby noo..."
herotalk_149001,Me too! Maybe I should stop mixing Nuka-Cola and Espresso to drink...
herotalk_149002,"I'm a busy bee, hiding in a steel beehive underneath!"
herotalk_149003,"Oh, you know, make ceilings out of steel. A lot of asbestos is used, or that's what it looks like."
herotalk_150001,"You know, I'd die for the Vault!"
herotalk_150002,"Don't mention it, I'm just trying my best. If I'm helping the Vault, then I'm helping all of us."
herotalk_150003,Maybe you are right? But I won't trade my current life for anything.
herotalk_151001,We're safe in the Vault...right?
herotalk_151002,Want to listen to the radio later?
herotalk_151003,I've read reports on Wasteland creatures! They are so horrible!
herotalk_152001,"I want to paint you, any requests?"
herotalk_152002,"OK, I don't like to gossip, but have you heard...that thing?"
herotalk_152003,"If you can live a safe life even outside the Vault, would you choose to leave?"
herotalk_153001,"I'm wondering, what flavor of pizza is your favorite?"
herotalk_153002,Of course I'm into the classics—pepperoni.
herotalk_153003,I've been thinking about making a cake for you all. What flavor should I make?
herotalk_154002,My birthday is coming soon. What're ya gonna get me?
herotalk_154003,Is it daytime or night? I'm confused.
herotalk_155001,"I really want to raise a pet, do you have any pets?"
herotalk_155002,"Oh, the Eiffel Tower, of course, so romantic, if, you know...it was still there."
herotalk_155003,"Oh, aha, um...you really are a sweet talker."
herotalk_156001,Of course! The Overseer won't let anything happen on us!
herotalk_156002,I want a portrait of the Overseer. It may be useful in the future.
herotalk_156003,"No, never. I like living in the Vault. This is my home...for ever."
herotalk_157001,"I like the mix of Hawaiian, chicken, and tomatoes, but no anchovy."
herotalk_157002,Other Vaults? There are other Vaults?
herotalk_157003,"Hand knitting socks, this is what I'm good at."
herotalk_158001,"I want to learn binary code, then I would have some value when robots enslave us."
herotalk_158002,"I want to learn another language, what about you?"
herotalk_158003,"Not too much! I'm happy I'm in the Vault, not the Wasteland! You know...I'll die."
herotalk_159001,So horrible! You shouldn't joke about my sweet bread...
herotalk_159002,"Three layers of vanilla and walnut, plus coconut jelly."
herotalk_159003,Raisin berry flavor! Wait...does that fruit really exist?
herotalk_160001,You should consider lifting the hips.
herotalk_160002,"Sorry, no time for jokes."
herotalk_160003,"I've lost count of time, but does it matter?"
herocase_1001,"I'm ready for the Wasteland, anytime."
herocase_1002,Should I explore here? I'm waiting for your order.
herocase_1003,"I love expeditions, and the commands to send me off."
herocase_1004,Please send me to the Wasteland! You won't be disappointed.
herocase_1005,Is the expedition going to start? I cannot wait.
herocase_1006,Ready for the report of expedition?
herocase_1007,I'm back with fruitful results. Let's celebrate.
herocase_1008,Want to know what I've found? Please check the list.
herocase_1009,It's a pleasant expedition.
herocase_1010,I'm back! I think you need to spend some time to check over the loot.
herocase_200001,"Secluded, secluded - I do not want to be hit by them."
herocase_200002,Why they take this place as a stronghold? It's not a good place to defend..
herocase_200003,"Well, there's so much material here, I don't think it's easy to bring them all back."
herocase_200004,These Raiders are better than Institutes. At least I don't have to deal with endless Synthetic men.
herocase_200005,"Did you know? Except the Institution, the Raiders are also the organizations that the Commonwealth Wasteland people hate."
herocase_200006,"Darn it, the obstacles are blocking my view. I need to move a little farther to the left."
herocase_200007,"If we have more people and better weapons, we will not have to do it so carefully."
heroscene_101001,"I'm afraid there were a lot of people living here but, none of them survived."
heroscene_101002,If there were more more materials here we wouldn't need to run about.
heroscene_101003,What a pity. There's no usable materials anymore.
heroscene_101004,The structure is intact and no nesting trace. A good place for a stronghold.
heroscene_101005,What were the people cleaning the sewer are called before the War?
heroscene_101006,All computers break down here. What a shame...But we won't use them anyway even if they ran well.
heroscene_101007,"I think, if we can fix some Mr. Handy, it'll save us a lot of efforts."
heroscene_101008,I'm wondering why we can always get construction materials we want in the sewer?
heroscene_101009,We can use these materials after expelling the Feral Ghouls here.
heroscene_101010,When can we have a decent farm...
heroscene_101011,Raiders here have killed a great many Minutemen during out getaway.
heroscene_101012,"Too many settlements are in need but, we only have limited hands. What should we do..."
heroscene_101013,"Well, I've found a shabbier camp than ours."
heroscene_101014,There are many construction materials we need here. I could purchase at will if you agree...
heroscene_102001,"If I was born before the War, could I have lived here like normal people do?"
heroscene_102002,"Deathclaw? All right, at least not Synthetic Deathclaw. We can still handle it."
heroscene_102003,"You want me to control the network for you? Come on, this is not a science fiction."
heroscene_102004,Don't look at me like that. Synths are not robots.
heroscene_102005,It's so easy to be penetrated for a camp this obvious.
heroscene_102006,"Although I don't like Brotherhood of Steel, it's a good place to be used as a fort here."
heroscene_102007,I've traveled to Diamond City before but it was a very long time ago.
heroscene_103001,"It must have been so cozy here before the War, but human's abuse of technology led to its devastation."
heroscene_103002,There's no remaining pre-War high-tech here. Is it a good news or bad news?
heroscene_103003,This place was full of laughter before the War. But now everything is gone.
heroscene_103004,The Institute did not send Synths to collect techs here. So unbelievable.
heroscene_103005,This is the consequence of dangerous technology. Robots should be born to serve people.
heroscene_103006,The defense of this camp is so weak. Super mutants can easily breach it.
heroscene_103007,I'm so excited to see a colleague again.
heroscene_103008,Finally find a large town with pretty much only humans living inside.
heroscene_104001,(Dogmeat runs over to Preston and comes back to you.)
heroscene_104002,(Dogmeat sniffs back and forth. He seems to be looking for something.)
heroscene_104003,(Dogmeat wiggles his nose. He seems to hate the smell here.)
heroscene_104004,(Dogmeat ran Preston and comes back to you.)
heroscene_104005,(Dogmeat shoots away under a dog food poster and joyfully wags his tail to you.)
heroscene_105001,Who wants to live in this hell? Does he want to raise Mirelurks here?
heroscene_105002,These mutant scorpions are really tough. Countless people in the Wasteland have died because of them.
heroscene_105003,"Preston takes good care of this place which, is a good start."
heroscene_105004,God knows where these Brotherhood Of Steel guys are coming from and what they plan to do.
heroscene_105005,"The Minutemen were well known here by the Commonwealth but, it's all history now."
heroscene_106001,When will the Feral Ghouls come to a stop?
heroscene_106002,I've met some Brotherhood of Steel back in the Capital Wasteland. They are much more friendly.
heroscene_106003,"Compared with Diamond City, Goodneighbor is more comfortable for people like me."
heroscene_107001,Protect the settlers! We must repel these Raiders!
heroscene_107002,This Deathclaw was already hurt by us. Killing him is just one shot away.
heroscene_107003,"Without your help, I really don't know how these refugees could survive here."
heroscene_107004,"As long as these monsters are wiped out, the Minutemen can build a settlement here."
heroscene_107005,Chem dealers always collude with Raiders. We'd better take them out.
heroscene_107006,"Before the Quincy Massacre, we helped the Commonwealth settlers just like this."
heroscene_107007,"We used to use this place as the stronghold, but the Feral Ghouls attacked us."
heroscene_107008,We will eliminate all Raiders here to ensure the safety of the Commonwealth!
heroscene_107009,We'll rebuild the Minutemen here in order to reconstruct the whole Commonwealth Wasteland.
heroscene_107010,"If Brotherhood of Steel is willing to cooperate with us, we'll rebuild Wasteland much faster."
heroscene_107011,"Despite after all these years, Diamond City is still intimidated by Super Mutants."
heroscene_108001,This is the evil consequence of humans abusing technologies before the War. They ruined the whole world.
heroscene_108002,The Institute created monsters called Synths. We must eliminate them all.
heroscene_108003,Pre-War technology has a extraordinary significance to Brotherhood of Steel.
heroscene_108004,"Feral Ghouls are easy to deal with, but the amount is too big."
heroscene_108005,"Except for the possible medicines, I hope you can also be aware of the possible pre-War technologies left here."
heroscene_108006,"You helped Brotherhood of Steel so, we will also help you."
heroscene_108007,If the Minutemen could assist Brotherhood of Steel that would be a win-win for both sides.
heroscene_108008,I'll build a bridge tower here to guarantee the next action of Brotherhood of Steel.
heroscene_108009,I have to say the safety conditions are much worse than the place I used to live in when I was a child.
heroscene_109001,"I think, after finishing all constructions in the Vault, we can build a hospital here."
heroscene_109002,"We can't let them know I'm not a human, can we?"
heroscene_109003,Is it always so lively in Diamond City?
heroscene_110001,"...Whether before or after the War, there are always people doing the detective job."
heroscene_110002,"If there's something the Diamond City security cannot solve, come to me immediately."
heroscene_110003,"Yep. Though it's simple, the settlers here are very motivated."
heroscene_110004,These Brotherhood members didn't shoot me? So incredible.
heroscene_110005,"If you meet any problems the security cannot settle, please come to me."
heroscene_111001,A lot of the time I think I need helper cause I have too much trouble to deal with.
heroscene_111002,"Believe me, a long travel through the Wasteland is not a good experience."
heroscene_111003,I think the Minutemen will help me with the new research. What do you think?
heroscene_111004,"I have to say, settlers in the Capital Wasteland like the Brotherhood under Elder Lyons better."
heroscene_111005,"Anyhow, it's so much more prosperous here than Megaton. I really like it."
heroscene_112001,Interviewing Raiders is not a good idea. I won't have that crazy thought.
heroscene_112002,The Minutemen have always been helping us all this time. Maybe I can have an interview with them.
heroscene_112003,Settlers in the Commonwealth are very much interested in the Brotherhood of Steel. So am I.
heroscene_112004,"In case you want to visit my newspaper office, it's on the right of the Diamond City gate."

AdventureEv_Before_001,"Attention! My device is picking up some unusual energy resistance here, we have no idea what it is. Should we investigate?"

AdventureEv_Before_003,"A group of adventurers want to trade resources with us, shall we take a look?"
AdventureEv_After_001,"We activated the medical device with some silver souvenir coins, luckily, it's in perfect working order. Our team recovered very well."

AdventureEv_After_003,"Trading with these adventurers has been successful, they got what they wanted and we got what we wanted, everyone's happy."
AdventureEv_Before_101,"There is an abandoned medical device, it's not actually broken. If we are willing to give up some goods, I believe it will work, should we use it?"
AdventureEv_Before_102,"We met a Wasteland merchant by chance, looks like he has a lot of tradable goods, let's talk to him."
AdventureEv_Before_103,"A group of people claiming to be Ex-Triggermen stopped us in our tracks, they want to do business with us. We should approach them in a friendly way, we don't want any trouble."
AdventureEv_After_101,"It's very hard to keep this medical device running, it looks like it will break any second, but luckily it gave us enough time to recover."
AdventureEv_After_102,"No wonder he's a Wasteland merchant, he has all kinds of things to trade. Don't know how they do it, but that's a travelling merchant all right."
AdventureEv_After_103,"These Ex-Triggermen aren't easy to deal with, so we should agree on a friendly deal, get what we want and go."
AdventureEv_After_004,"Following the signals, we found a simple hiding place abandoned and empty, it gave our team a good rest."
AdventureEv_After_005,"I had no idea what they were talking about, and had to deal with them in radiation... but eventually they sent us supplies."
AdventureEv_After_006,"It sickens me, the thought of them forcing me to kiss the nuke, ahem, even IF they left us some supplies."
AdventureEv_After_007,"Darn it, this bunch of lunatics! Had no idea what they were talking about, they just started shooting at us despite our good will..."
AdventureEv_After_008,"These people seem to be well-intentioned, and gave us...some so called food, for us to eat. I don't know what you'll feel after eating this stuff though."
AdventureEv_After_009,"These people ran when they saw us, and it took us great effort to catch them, but at least they knew we meant no harm in the end."
AdventureEv_After_010,"The meeting was nice, so was the booze they offered. I was the only one sobered in my team."
AdventureEv_After_011,"What a shame! This was once a good piece of old-tech, but destroyed by radiation. We even suffered a little to recover it."
AdventureEv_After_012,Who would imagine the relic we found was in a large sealed off room of radiation...don't know who left it in there but it gave us enough headache.
AdventureEv_After_013,Such a disaster! The relic we hoped to recover suddenly blew up... We couldn't figure out what it was. And my team...

AdventureEv_After_802,Dave did what he said - Saashi and Jessica made a lot of bread together.
AdventureEv_After_803,"The pharmacist sold all the potions. Seeing the weird smile on his face, I feel that we were scammed."

You don't look like a mayor at your age.""\n\nMacCready manages a smile, recalling his unruly days of childhood when he was the mayor of Little Lamplight and leading a group of kids about his age. Though 12 back then, he never feared any adult. He would curse and point the oversized rifle right at your head when pissed off.\n\nGood days were fleeting. According to the tradition of Little Lamplight, MacCready left the town at 16 and became a mercenary. The vast wasteland was filled dangers and challenges for the young man. But MacCready's extraordinary marksmanship always kept his belly full until the day he met Lucy.\n\nTwists in life always came in a sudden. A second before MacCready was a fearless young hireling, the next moment he became a husband and a father. Brave and gentle, Lucy could always help MacCready through tough wasteland nights. And Duncan's birth brought the wandering duo happiness of parenthood.\n\nThinking of it, MacCready sheds tears inside. Lucy died in a subway station overrun by Feral Ghouls while MacCready escaped with unbearable pain and Duncan. Since then, MacCready decided to be a responsible father, a better person. He built a farm and lived in peace with Duncan.\n\nYet fate seemed to disfavor MacCready. Shortly after, Duncan caught a strange illness that no doctor had ever heard of. And Duncan became weaker and weaker day by day. MacCready was so worried that he had to pick up his rifle again and head to the Commonwealth Wasteland to try his luck. And he was only 21 that year.\n\n""Yeah, I used be a mayor. But that was an old story.""\n\nMacCready drunk up the ale and walked out of the Third Rail with his rifle on his back. Now he has gone back to his old business as a mercenary. What's different this time is that he does it to save his son."

Before he could realize, the dog bites tight his ankle.\n\n""Ahhhh!""\n\nLarry screams and soon regrets because he did it like a girl. No wastelander would fear a bandit who screams like a girl.\n\n""Alright, good boy, I know he feels sorry.""\n\nThe drilling pain from the ankle suddenly eases off as Larry notices the dog sits down and sticks his tongue out in excitement, a double-barreled shotgun pointing at his face.\n\nThe guy in the front is the tramp Larry was going to rob a minute ago. He wears a modified vault costume, his beard untrimmed and face haggard. Except for the shotgun, a 10mm pistol and a plasma grenade stick to his waist. Raising an eyebrow, he stares at Larry with a teasing look.\n\n""You're a bad bandit!""\n\nLarry blushes and replies with jabbering: \n\n""No... That's...not... If it weren't for the slip of the hand... And your...dog... Ouch... Pure devil...""\n\n""Dogmeat would be displeased to hear that."" The tramp frowns, ""you know, Dogmeat is the best friend to wastelanders. He helped Nick Valentine solve cases and Minutemen break away from the Gunners... He's my best friend and he never leaves me behind in plight.""\n\n""Woof!"" Dogmeat seems to agree.\n\n""I hope you got the lesson today: Never underestimate the power of friend in the wasteland, even it's from a dog.""\n\n""Woof woof!"" Dogmeat suddenly stands up, something shining in his eyes.\n\n""Seems Dogmeat likes your scarf. Do you mind?""\n\nLarry nods mechanically and sees, with his mouth agape, the tramp ties his red scarf to Dogmeat and leaves.\n\nPerhaps it's time to quit the unpromising job."

Sir...!""\n\nThe quivering report from the other side of the communicator was interrupted by sharp noises. Then all fell into silence. Kells' face is stern. Seems it's a bad ending for the scout squad sent to the Commonwealth Wasteland. He casts a secret glance at the back of Arthur Maxson who remains silent and is gazing at the conspicuous ornament in the command room with his hands behind his back.\n\nThat's a broken banner embroidered the emblem of Brotherhood of Steel. What's supposed to be a gear now is replaced by the pattern of a fierce lion. Kells knows it's the flag for the ""Lyons Pride"", elite forces of the Brotherhood. The banner has been there since Predwin set sail.\n\n""Kells, I knew the scout mission would face hindrance and the warriors of Brotherhood had prepared themselves as well."" Maxson breaks the silence.\n\n""But I just can let go of any one of them so easily."" Maxson's eagle eyes flicker with tears.\n\n""Every moment like this, I would think of her... What she would do...""\n\nKells starts to picture that beautiful yet firm face. Sarah Lyons, leader of ""Lyons Pride"", pure warrior, is a person never gives up. Maxson has deep feelings towards this ""big sister"" even he has become the supreme and undisputable leader of Brotherhood. Many still feel Sarah's death is the soft spot in the heart of this tough guy.\n\nKells swallows. This is the first time Maxson mentions Sarah's name before him. Perhaps marching to the Commonwealth Wasteland is the most important yet difficult decision for Maxson to make.\n\n""I don't know what Sarah would do, Maxson. But I know she believes in you. The Brotherhood trusts you. Nothing will stop us as long as we forge ahead with a shared conviction!""\n\nMaxson turns back. It seems he has something to say, but he chooses to be silent at last. He stares at the banner of Lyons Pride as if the lion stares back.\n\n""Ad victoriam! Kells.""\n\n""Ad victoriam! Elder!"""

Assistants often talk about her, thinking there's nothing that can make her happy. Sometimes even ""Father"" feels Madison is too stressed out.\n\nOnly through an old and yellow photo on her desk could people see her smile. She was young and proud, full of hopes, like a pure crusader.\n\nShe decided to devote her life to the people in the wasteland.\n\nMadison and James, a scientist she had crush on, together joined the Purification Project. Her job was simple and tedious, sometimes even dangerous and lethal. But she never lost her smile because she knew she was fighting for humanity.\n\nHowever, the wasteland never tolerates such idealists.\n\nThe Purification Project was aborted because James left halfway. Indignant, Madison came to Rivet City and started a new life. Years passed as Madison became more cynic. But a strange visitor brought some sort of twist to her life.\n\nThat was James who looked a little old.\n\nWith the help of Brotherhood, James and Madison restarted the Purification Project. Even with Enclave standing in their way, they finished the project with success. But it came with a price: James left Madison forever.\n\nMadison started to hide her smile. It's not the tragedy that overwhelmingly pained her. It's because she finally realized that a dreamer leads to no end in the wasteland.\n\nWhat happened later proved it too: The military expansion of Brotherhood disappointed Madison and the two-faced way of Institute also made her sick. The world if only filled with benefits and power.\n\n""If I was still a dreamer, what would I do now?""\n\nMadison looks at the old photo again, her weary and frowned eyebrows widening a little. Then she buries herself in work again."

Least the guy knows to read, much better than the most of anonymous readers. ""They're afraid,"" Piper thinks so as she draws out the dagger from her beloved newspaper. ""They fear the power of truth.""\n\nThe power of truth is what keeps Piper going so far. When she was still a girl, Piper found her father, a local guard, dead under suspicious circumstances. It was the power of media and truth that helped Piper find the murderer and have him punished.\n\nWhen Piper and Nat, her younger sister, saved enough money to relocate to Diamond City, they decided to open a newspaper. Thus Publick Occurrences was born.\n\nBut eventually public opinion turned against her because her articles were seen as being ""too negative."" Isn't it bullshit? What's good news in an apocalyptic world like this?\n\nDespite these accusations, Piper continued to investigate bizarre cases in an attempt to discover truth with Publick Occurrences. The scheme of the Atom Cultist, clash between the Brotherhood and Institute... These words were printed on the newspaper and finally reached the hearts of wastelanders.\n\nNo matter how many troubles she got herself in and how many threats she received, truth deserves to be known by men."

Having been raised in the Institute has made him detached and he could only feel the warmness of home while looking at the book.\n\nBut it also reminds him of the reason he wakes up his father: The old man has long been tormented by an incurable disease and ironically, even the Institute's techs can not stop death. As ""Father"", he needs someone he trusts to take his place, leading ""the Institute to redefining humanity"". And that person is his father who's much younger than him now.\n\nIs it because of kinship? But he never experienced it. The old man shakes his head as he couldn't understand such feeling...

The gecko's eyes scrutinize around with alert and soon set the gaze at the corner where Arthur's hiding.\n\nArthur thinks of what Sarah taught him: This is a deathclaw, the most dangerous predator in the wasteland. They are a product of certain virus experiment, keen in senses. Any of their move can easily knock down an adult male. Some deathclaws can change their skin color and, more surprisingly, even imitate human speech to draw attention from their prey.\n\nBut Arthur is only 13, too young to even hold a laser pistol.\n\nThe deathclaw's footsteps is drawing near, each step slightly shaking the ground. Arthur feels his heart is about to bump out of his chest, wondering it's because he's too nervous or the footsteps are too heavy.\n\nBut suddenly he notices that not only the ground is shaking, an old and rusty Nuka-Cola sign at the roof is waving as well.\n\nA plan comes up in Arthur's mind, but it needs accurate marksmanship, courage and a bit luck.\n\nThe chance is fleeting.\n\nArthur takes a deep breath, rushes out of the corner and shouts at the deathclaw. Startled for a moment, the deathclaw soon gets back to its senses of predator and charges at Arthur at incredible speed.\n\nArthur draws the laser pistol and starts to aim, not at the deathclaw, but the teetering advertisement sign.\n\nWith a clear sound of gunshot, red laser pierces through the rusty pedestal. The sign board falls off with a deep moan, landing and smashing right on the deathclaw.\n\nThe gecko collapses, letting out a weak growl and lying still on the ground.\n\nGiving a sigh of relief, Arthur pats his numb legs and walks up to examine the body...\n\n""Ah!!!""\n\nThe deathclaw swings its talon at Arthur with its last drop of strength, leaving a trail of blood on Arthur's face before he falls back.\n\nMany years later, Arthur has become a respected Elder of the Brotherhood, he still keeps the trophy of that fight: The talon that scarred him. It reminds him that never forget to deal the final blow."

RobCo Industries will publish their online payment system for Pip-Boys within the next 5 years... which means, we can do micro-transactions in the game.

No. You're not dead. Stranger. You are in the crater of Atom.

And the woman's robe also has the sigil of the Church. He starts to panic as he remembers that the Children of Atom are a group of crazy people and fanatics. \n\n""Uh... I am so sorry... I didn't know that I ran into the territory of the Church. May I have your name....""\n\n""My brothers and sisters call me Mother. You can call me Isolde.” "" The woman's tone is surprisingly calm and reassuring\n\n""You don't need to worry. You coming here is the will of Atom. I believe that the power of Atom wishes you to become one of us.” \n\n Russell slowly feels a sense of relief, quickly shifting to fear as he realizes something is very wrong. He struggles to crawl from the bed. \n\n""What are you doing? I promise... you are free from danger..."" the woman sounds perplexed. \n\nRussell doesn't respond and finally finds what he was looking for; a mirror. \n\nHe raises the mirror in the dim light. \n\nThere is a pale and rotten face in the mirror. The hair has already fallen away, and a pair of dark eyes return Russel's putrid gaze."

TESArchive_name_001,A Brief History of the Empire
TESArchive_des_001,"Volume I of this series describes in brief detail the lives of the first eight Septim Emperors. Beginning with the glorious Tiber Septim. The second volume describes the War of the Red Diamond and the six Emperors that followed its aftermath. The third volume describes the troubles of the next three Emperors: the frustrated Uriel IV, the ineffective Cephorus II, and the heroic Uriel V. The last volume is the story of the remaining emperors, as well as Jaga Sann. \n\nOn Uriel V's death, across the sea in the distant and hostile Akavir, Uriel VI was but five years old. In fact, Uriel VI was born just shortly before his father left for Akavir. Uriel V's only other descendants were the twins Morihatha and Eloisa, who were born a month after Uriel V left. Uriel VI was crowned in the 290th year of the Third Era. The Imperial Consort Thonica, the boy's mother, was given limited power until Uriel VI reached maturity. The Elder Council retained the real power, as they had since the days of Katariah. \n\nThe Council enjoyed its unlimited and unrestricted freedom to decree laws (and generate profits). Uriel VI was not given power until 307, when he was already 22 years old. He had been slowly assuming positions of responsibility, but both the Council and his mother, who enjoyed her limited power, were unwilling to hand over the reins. By the time he sat on the throne, the mechanisms of the government gave him little power except for that of the imperial veto. \n\nThis power, however, was used quite regularly. By 313, Uriel VI could boast with conviction that he truly did rule Tamriel. He utilized the defunct spy networks and guard units to bully and coerce difficult members on the Elder Council. His half-sister Morihatha Septim was (not surprisingly) his staunchest ally, especially after her marriage to Baron Ulfe Gersen of Winterhold brought her considerable wealth and influence. As the Sage Ugaridge said, ""Uriel V conquered Esroniet, but Uriel VI conquered the Elder Council."" \n\nWhen Uriel VI fell off a horse and could not be saved even by the finest Imperial healers, his beloved sister Morihatha took up the imperial crown. At 25 years of age, she had been described by (admittedly self-serving) diplomats as the most beautiful creature in all of Tamriel. She was very smart, vivacious, athletic, and a well-practiced politician. She brought the Archmagister of Skyrim to the Imperial City and created the second Imperial Battlemage. The last since the days of Tiber Septim. \n\nMorihatha finished the job her brother had begun,and made Cyrodiil a true government under the Empress (and later, the Emperor). Outside of Cyrodiil, however, the Empire had been slowly disintegrating into chaos. Open revolutions and civil wars had went unchallenged since the days of her grandfather, Cephorus II. By carefully coordinating her counterattacks, Morihatha Septim, slowly took control of the rebellious vassals. \n\nThough Morihatha's military campaigns were remarkably successful, her deliberate slow pace often frustrated the Council. One Councilman, an Argonian, who took the Colovian name of Thoricles Romus, was furious at her refusal to send troops to his troubled Black Marsh. He is commonly believed to have hired the assassins who claimed her life in 3E 339. Romus was subsequently tried and executed, though he protested his innocence to his last moments. \n\nMorihatha had no surviving children and Eloisa had died of a fever four years before. Eloisa's 25-year-old son Pelagius was thus crowned Pelagius Septim IV. Pelagius Septim IV continued his aunt's work, slowly bringing the rebelling kingdoms, duchies, and baronies of the Empire back under his control. He had Morihatha's poise and slow calculated pace, but alas, he did not attain her success. The kingdoms had been free from constraint for so long that even a benign Imperial presence was considered repulsive. Nevertheless, after a notably stable and prosperous forty-nine-year reign, Tamriel was now closer to unity than it had been since the days of Uriel I. \n\nOur current Emperor, His Awesome and Terrible Majesty, Uriel Septim VII, son of Pelagius, has the diligence of his great-aunt Morihatha, the political skill of his great-uncle Uriel VI, and the military prowess of his great grand-uncle Uriel V. For the twenty-one years he has reigned he has brought justice and order to Tamriel. In the year 3E 389, however, his Imperial Battlemage, Jagar Tharn, betrayed him. \n\nUriel VII was imprisoned in a dimension Tharn created. Tharn used his skills in illusions to assume the Emperor's appearance. For the next ten years, Tharn abused the imperial privilege and did not continue Uriel VII's plan of reconquest. It is not yet entirely known what Tharn's goals and accomplishments were during the ten years he masqueraded as his liege lord. In 3E 399, an enigmatic Champion defeated the Battlemage in the dungeons of the Imperial Palace and freed Uriel VII from his other-dimensional jail. \n\nSince his emancipation, Uriel Septim VII has worked diligently to renew the battles that would reunite Tamriel. True, Tharn's interference broke the momentum, but the years since then have proven that there is hope that a Golden Age of Tiber Septim's rule will bring Tamriel to glory once again."
TESArchive_name_002,Gods and Worship in Tamriel
TESArchive_des_002,"Gods are often judged by the views of their followers. A central belief is that the Deities are actively participating in the mundane matters. Some that challenge this belief point out that there are still times of plague and famine. \n\nFrom intervention in legendary quests to manifestations in common daily life, there is no pattern that the Gods of Tamriel are active in the world. It seems that people either worry about the gods or do not have them in their hearts. The exceptions do exist, however. \n\nMany historical records and legends point to the direct intervention of one or more gods at times of great need. Many heroic tales recount the blessings of the divine Gods that were bestowed upon heroic figures who worked for the good of them or their temples. Some of the more powerful artifacts in the known world were originally bestowed upon their owners through these godly rewards. It has also been reported that the high-ranking priests of their temples may on occasion call upon their Deity for blessings or help in times of need. The exact nature of such contact with Deities and the blessings bestowed is shrouded in mystery, as the temples hold such associations secret. This direct contact gives weight to the belief that the Gods are aware of the mortal realm. In many circumstances however, these same Gods will do nothing in the face of suffering and death, appearing to feel no need to interfere with mortal affairs. It is possible to conclude that we, as mortals, may not be capable of understanding more than a small fraction of the reasoning such celestial beings use. \n\nOne defining characteristic of all Gods and Goddesses is their interest in worship and deeds. Deeds in the form of holy quests are just one of the many things that get the attention of a Deity. Deeds in everyday life, by conforming to the statutes and obligations of individual temples, are commonly thought to please a Deity. Performing ceremonies in a temple, may also get a Deity's attention. Ceremonies will vary according to the individual Deity. The results are not always apparent but sacrifice and offerings are usually required to have any hope of gaining a Deity's attention. \n\nWhile direct intervention in daily temple life has been recorded, the exact nature of the presence of a God in daily mundane life is still up for great speculation. A traditional saying of the Wood Elves states: ""One man's miracle is another man's accident."" While some Gods are believed to take an active part in daily life, others are well known for their lack of interest in mortal affairs. \n\nIt has been theorized that Gods do, in fact, gain strength from such things as worship such as praise, sacrifice, and good deeds. It has even been theorized that the number of worshippers a given Deity has may reflect on his or her overall position amongst the other Gods. This is my own conclusion, garnered from the ability of the larger temples to attain blessings and assistance from their God with greater ease than smaller ones. \n\nThere are reports of the existence of spirits in our world that have the same capacity to use the actions and deeds of mortals to strengthen themselves. The understanding of the exact nature of such creatures would allow us to understand with more clarity the connection between a Deity and the Deity's worshipers. \n\nThe suggestion that the existence of such spirits leads to the speculation that these spirits may even be capable of raising themselves to the level of a God or Goddess. Motusuo of the Imperial Seminary has suggested that these spirits may be the remains of Gods and Goddesses who, through time, lost all or most of their followers. Thus, reverting to their earliest, most basic form. Practitioners of the Old Ways say that there are no Gods, just greater and lesser spirits. Perhaps it is possible for all three theories to be correct."

He is known as the Huntsman and Father of Man beasts. \n\nMalacath, who feeds off the patronage of the spurned and ostracized, is known as the keeper of the Sworn Oath and the Bloody Curse. \n\nMehrunes Dagon is the God of destruction, change, revolution, energy, and ambition. \n\nMephala, whose sphere of influence is obscured to mortals, is known by the names Webspinner, Spinner, and Spider. The only consistent theme seems to be her interference in the affairs of mortals for her own amusement. \n\nMeridia, whose sphere of influence is also obscured to mortals, is associated with the energies of living things. \n\nMolag Bal, whose realm is the domination and enslavement of mortals, desires to harvest the souls of mortals and to bring mortals souls into his sway by sowing seeds of strife and discord. \n\nNamira, whose sphere of influence is the ancient Darkness, is known as the Spirit Daedra, ruler of sundry dark and shadowy spirits. She is associated with spiders, insects, slugs, and other repulsive creatures that disgust mortals. \n\nNocturnal, whose sphere of influence is the night and the darkness, is known as the Night Mistress. \n\nPeryite, whose sphere is the lowest order of Oblivion, is known as the Taskmaster. \n\nSanguine, whose sphere of influence is hedonistic revelry, debauchery, and the passionate indulgences of the darker natures. \n\nSheogorath, whose sphere of influence is Madness, has motives that are unknown. \n\nVaernima, whose sphere of influence is the realm of dreams and nightmares where evil omens come from. \n\n[Specially marked for special interest under the heading ""Malacath"" you can find a reference to Scourge, blessed by Malacath, and dedicated to the use of mortals. In short, the reference suggests that any Daedra attempting to invoke the weapon's powers will be expelled into the voidstreams of Oblivion.] \n\n""Of the legendary Deadra artifacts, many are well known, like Azura's Star and Sheogorath's Wabbajack. There are others that are less well known, like Scourge, Mackkan's Hammer, Bane of Daedra....""\n\n""...although Malacath blessed Scourge to be powerful against his Daedra kin, he thought not that it should fall into Daedric hands. Instead to serve as a tool for the war amongst the forsaken. Malacath cursed the device so that, should any dark kin seek to invoke its powers, a void would open and swallow that Daedra, purging them into Oblivion's void streams. From thence they will seek it.

TESArchive_name_004,Mixed Unit Tactics
TESArchive_des_004,"The Legions could learn from the unconventional tactics used by the Khajiit in the Five-Year War against Valenwood. I was stationed at the Sphinxmoth Legion Fort on the border near Dune, there I witnessed many of the northern skirmishes firsthand. \n\nThe war started with the so-called ""Slaughter of Torval."" The Khajiit claim that the Bosmer invaded the city without provocation and killed over a thousand citizens before being driven off by reinforcements from a nearby jungle tribe. The Bosmer claim that the attack was in retaliation for Khajiti bandits who were attacking wood elf caravans headed for Valenwood. \n\nIn the spring of 3E 396 the war moved closer to Fort Sphinxmoth. I was posted as a lookout and saw parts of the conflict. While I was posted as a lookout and saw parts of the conflict. I later spoke with both the Khajiit and the Bosmer who fought in the battle. It will serve as an excellent example of how the Khajiit used a mixture of ground and tree units to win the war. \n\nThe Khajiit began the fight in an unusual way, by sending tree-cutting teams of Cathay-rahts and the fearsome Senche-rahts or ""Battlecats"" into the forests outside Valenwood. When word reached the Bosmer that trees were being felled (allegedly a crime in the strange Bosmeri religion), a unit of archers were moved from larger conflicts in the south. The Bosmer were thus goaded into splitting their forces into smaller groups. \n\nThe Bosmer archers took up positions in the remaining trees, whose branches were now twenty or more feet apart, allowing some light to reach the forest floor. The Bosmer bent the remaining trees with their magic into small fortifications from which to fire their bows. \n\nWhen the tree-cutters arrived the next morning, a half dozen Khajiit fell to the Bosmer arrows in the first volley. After that the Khajiit took large wooden shields from the backs of the Senche-rahts and made a crude shelter. The Khajiit, and even the enormous Senche-rahts, were able to hide between this shelter and one of the larger trees. When it became apparent that the Khajiit would not leave their shelter, some Bosmer choose to descend and engage the Khajiit sword-to-claw. \n\nWhen the Bosmer were nearly upon the shelter, one of the Khajiit began playing a native instrument made of metal bars. This was a signal of some kind to a small group of the man-like Ohmes and Ohmes-rahts who emerged from covered holes on the forest floor. Although outnumbered, they had the element of surprise and by attacking from behind they quickly won the fight. \n\nThe Bosmer archers in the trees would have still won the battle if they not having troubles of their own. A group of Dagi and Dagi-rahts, two of the less common forms of Khajiit, who live in the trees of the Tenmar forest, jumped from one tree to another under a magical cover of silence. They took up positions in the higher branches that could not hold a Bosmer's weight. When the signal came, they used their claws and either torches or spells of fire (accounts from the two survivors I spoke with vary on this point) to distract the archers while the battle on the ground took place. A few of the archers were able to flee, but most were killed. \n\nApparently the Dagi and Dagi-rahts must have more magical ability than what is widely believed as they were able to keep themselves magically hidden for so long. One of the surviving Bosmer told me that he saw a few ordinary cats among the Dagi and even claimed that these ordinary cats are known as 'Alfiq' and could cast spells. But, the Bosmer are almost as unreliable as the Khajiit when it comes to the truth and I cannot believe that a housecat can cast spells. \n\nAt the end of the day the Khajiit lost around a half-dozen fighters out of no more than four dozen, while the Bosmer lost nearly an entire company of archers. The survivors were unable to report back before a second company of archers arrived and this strategy was repeated again, with similar results.\nFinally, a much larger force was sent and the Bosmer won that battle with the help of the native animals of Valenwood. The third skirmish and the Khajiiti response will be discussed in the second volume of this series."
TESArchive_name_005,Of Crossed Daggers
TESArchive_des_005,"Situated on the eastern banks of Lake Honrich, the city of Riften serves as a reminder of a bygone era. The once-proud streets and buildings have vanished. They have been replaced with a collection of wooden structures and rough stonework shrouded in a permanent fog-like mist. In order to understand how such a large city became nothing more than a glorified fortress, one need only look to the history books for answers. \n\nRiften was a major hub of activity for trade caravans and travelers to and from Morrowind. Fishing skiffs could be seen dotting the lake at all hours of the day and the bustling city was alive with activity at night. The city guard was formidable and maintained a tight grasp on its populace, keeping them safe from harm. The marketplace in Riften was also quite the draw, containing numerous stalls offering wares from across Tamriel. \n\nIn 4E 98, amidst the confusion of the Void Nights, Hosgunn Crossed-Daggers was named as Jarl after the previous Jarl had been assassinated. Although many believe that Hosgunn was responsible, and cries of protest filled the streets of Riften, the Jarl took the throne and immediately took action to protect his station. Using the city guard, he had the streets cleared of protesters and initiated a curfew. Anyone caught breaking the curfew was immediately jailed without due process or executed if it was a repeat offence. \n\nFor over 40 years, Hosgunn ruled Riften with a black heart and an iron fist. He imposed ridiculous taxes upon his subjects and any merchants that wished to sell their wares within his city walls. Hosgunn kept most of the coin for himself, using it to construct a massive wooden castle with unnecessarily lavish rooms within. The castle took seven years to build and became a visual reminder of the people's oppression. This earned it the nickname ""Hosgunn's Folly."" Towards the end of his reign, the streets of Riften became littered with garbage and its people plagued by hunger and disease. \n\nThen, in 4E 129, the people had finally had enough. With their superior numbers, they were able to temporarily overwhelm the city guard for long enough to set Hosgunn's Folly, with the greedy Jarl in it, on fire. As the fighting raged, the fire spread through the city unchecked. By morning, the people had emerged victorious, but it was not without a great cost. Most of the city was now in ruins and many had died. \n\nIt took five years to rebuild Riften into the smaller city that it is today. And even though over fifty years have passed since then, it has still yet to fully recover. Some believe it will never achieve the level of affluence it saw at the beginning of the Fourth Era, but there are a few who still hold on to the hope that Riften can return from the ashes and become a center of commerce once again."
TESArchive_name_006,The Cabin in the Woods
TESArchive_des_006,"Late one night, a few seasons ago, a soldier was returning home after several bloody battles. He decided he would save some gold and try to cross the pine forest on foot. \n\nThe first day of his journey was rather uneventful, the soldier stuck to the main path and kept a brisk pace. When it started getting dark, he set up his bedroll, built a small fire, and cooked some rabbit he had caught. ""A fine day indeed"", he thought to himself as he fell asleep. \n\nPartway through the night, the soldier was awoken by the sounds of someone sobbing softly in the distance. He grabbed his sword, assuming it to be a bandit's trap, but pretended to sleep so he could get the jump on them. After a few minutes, the sounds of sobbing started moving farther away from his camp until he could no longer hear them. For the rest of the night, he slept with his eyes open. \n\nDay two, the soldier awoke from what little sleep he had gotten and started off through the forest at a quicker pace, intending to put distance between himself and whatever he had heard last night. As the day went on, it began to rain heavily, so the soldier built himself a shelter for the evening. \n\nIt took him a little longer to fall asleep with thoughts of the previous night still fresh in his mind, but eventually he fell asleep. \n\nThis time he awoke to the sounds of sobbing, right outside his shelter. The soldier grabbed his sword and crawled out of the shelter. In front of the fire, he saw the back of a ghostly woman weeping into her hands. \n\nThe soldier mustered his courage and asked her what was wrong. \n\nThere was no answer. \n\nHe slowly began to approach, but before he could reach her, she turned and wailed at him. The ghostly woman raised an axe and ran at the soldier, disappearing before making contact. The soldier took off into the night with nothing except the sword in his hand. He ran until the light of dawn where he started down the road again, running as fast as he could. \n\nThe third day was bright and sunny, but the soldier, rattled and fatigued, failed to notice. He moved as fast as he could, trying desperately to traverse the forest before nightfall. \n\nAs darkness crept in, he came upon a cabin just off the road and thought it would be a good place to bunker down for the night. After arriving at the cabin, he spent some time barricading the doors and the windows. Nothing could get in. Despite his preparations, he could not sleep. He sat in what used to be the cabin's bedroom, staring at the barricaded door, shaking. Eventually he could keep his eyes open no longer and fell asleep. \n\nThis time, he awoke to the sounds of laughter on the other side of the barricaded door. It sounded like the woman before, but he refused to believe it was her. The soldier burst through the door to find the ghostly woman from the night before staring at the ground, laughing hysterically with axe in hand. \n\nFrantically, he began to attack the ghostly woman, but his strikes were ineffective. He used a scroll of Fireball which drew forth a horrid scream from the ghost. She exploded and disappeared. The ordeal was over, the ghost was gone. \n\nThe soldier slept well that night and the next day made excellent progress through the woods. As the sun began to set, he emerged on the other side of the forest and looked back, remembering his time there. \n\nAs he turned and began his walk away from the woods, he swore he could hear the sobbing again."

TESArchive_name_008,Madmen of the Reach
TESArchive_des_008,"Since the legendary victory of Tiber Septim over the ""barbarian natives"" in the Battle of Old Hroldan, Imperial and Nord scholars have described the people of the Reach as little more than savages, prone to irrational fits of violence, worshipping old, heretical gods, and fetishizing beasts and nature spirits that any civilized person would best well avoid. In truth, these accounts are little more than ""victor's essays,"" a perspective from the Empire's constant strife with an ancient, proud people that lived in this land far before Tiber Septim even walked the soil of Tamriel. In light of this, I hope to create a more complete, accurate, and fair assessment of a group that has long suffered under the label of ""enemy,"" ""troublemakers,"" and ""them."" \n\nLet us begin with the Forsworn, the so-called ""madmen"" of the Reach. The Imperial Legion classifies them as little more than brigands, noting their constant raids and ambushes within the Hold. But none of their military reports asks the question of ""why?"" If they were merely a group of bandits, surely they would be focused on acquiring gold and minimizing deaths amongst their own. But the opposite is true in Forsworn attacks. Large sums of coins are often left behind and their fighters easily throw away their lives rather than risk capture by Imperial soldiers. \n\nIt is this contradiction that led me to Markarth, the capital city of the Reach, in search of answers. There, I met one of the native peoples, an old woman who preferred to not be named in my writings. She told me of her family's long history. How she believes they originally came from High Rock, home of the Bretons (which would explain the similar faces and stature of the two peoples). How the Nords came and took their lands, their gods, and their culture from them. When asked about the Forsworn, the old woman would say that they are the ""real"" men and women of the Reach: those that refused to give in to the Nords. Those that still practice the ancient traditions that the rest of their people had abandoned in exchange for peace. \n\nIn time, I was able to create trust with many more natives in my search that corroborated the old woman's story. By chance, one of them arranged a meeting between myself and what I thought was an elder member of his village. I was shocked to find that I was led to a camp, filled with the animal skulls, severed heads, and still beating hearts that I had read about from the military reports back in the Imperial City. There, I met Cortoran, a Forsworn, who seemed amused at the prospect of me writing down his story. Which I quote in full below:\n\n""You want to know who the Forsworn are? We are the people who must pillage our own land. Burn our own ground. We are the scourge of the Nords. The axe that falls in the dark. The scream before the gods that claim your soul. We are the true sons and daughters of the Reach. The spirits and hags have lived here from the beginning and they are on our side. Go back. Go back and tell your Empire that we will have our own kingdom again. And on that day, we will be the ones burying your dead in a land that is no longer yours."""
TESArchive_name_009,Immortal Blood
TESArchive_des_009,"The moons and stars were hidden from sight, making that particular night especially dark. The town guards had to carry torches to make their rounds; but the man who came to call at my chapel carried no light with him. I came to learn that Movarth Piquine could see in the dark almost as well as the light - an excellent talent, considering his interests were exclusively nocturnal. \n\nOne of my acolytes brought him to me and from the look of him, I at first thought he was in need of healing. He was pale to the point it was opalescent with a face that looked like it had once been very handsome before some unspeakable suffering. The dark circles under his eyes implied exhaustion, but the eyes themselves were alert, intense, and almost insane. \n\nHe quickly dismissed my notion that he himself was ill, though he did want to discuss a specific disease. \n\n""Vampirism,"" he said, and then paused at my quizzical look. ""I was told that you were someone I should seek out for help understanding it."" ""Who told you that?"" I asked with a smile. \n\n""Tissina Gray"" \n\nI immediately remembered her. A brave, beautiful knight who had needed my assistance, separating fact from fiction on the subject of the vampires. It had been two years and I had never heard whether my advice had proved effective. \n\n""You've spoken to her? How is her ladyship?"" I asked. \n\n""Dead,"" Movarth replied coldly and then, responding to my shock, he added to perhaps soften the blow. ""She said your advice was invaluable, at least for the one vampire. When last I talked to her, she was tracking another. It killed her."" \n\n""Then the advice I gave her was not enough,"" I sighed. ""Why do you think it would be enough for you?"" \n\n""I was a teacher once myself, years ago,"" He said. ""Not in a university. A trainer in the Fighters Guild. But I know that if a student doesn't ask the right questions, the teacher cannot be responsible for his failure. I intend to ask you the right questions."" \n\nAnd that he did. For hours, he asked questions and I answered what I could, but he never volunteered any information about himself. He never smiled. He only studied me with those intense eyes of his, committing every word I said to memory. \n\nFinally, I turned the questioning around. ""You said you were a trainer at the Fighters Guild. Are you on an assignment for them?"" \n\n""No,"" he said curtly, and finally I could detect some weariness in those feverish eyes of his. ""I would like to continue this tomorrow night, if I could. I need to get some sleep and absorb this."" \n\n""You sleep during the day,"" I smiled. \n\nTo my surprise, he returned the smile, though it was more of a grimace. ""When tracking your prey, you adapt their habits."" \n\nThe next day, he did return with more questions, these ones very specific. He wanted to know about the vampires of eastern Skyrim. I told him of the most powerful tribe, the Volkihar Clan, paranoid and cruel, whose very breath could freeze their victims' blood in the veins. I explained to him how they lived beneath the ice of remote haunted lakes, never venturing into the world of men except to feed. \n\nMovarth Piquine listened carefully and asked more questions into the night, until at last he was ready to leave. \n\n""I will not see you for a few days,"" he said. ""But I will return and tell you how helpful your information has been."" \n\nTrue to his word, the man returned to my chapel shortly after midnight four days later. There was a fresh scar on his cheek, but he was smiling that grim but satisfied smile of his. \n\n""Your advice helped me very much,"" he said. ""But you should know that the Volkihar have an additional ability you didn't mention. They can reach through the ice of their lakes without breaking it. It was quite a nasty surprise, being grabbed from below without any warning."" \n\n""How remarkable,"" I said with a laugh. ""And terrifying. You're lucky you survived."" \n\n""I don't believe in luck. I believe in knowledge and training. Your information helped me, and my melee combat skills sealed the bloodsucker's fate. I've never believed in weaponry of any kind. Too many unknowns. Even the best swordsmith has created a flawed blade, but you know what your body is capable of. I know I can land a thousand blows without losing my balance, provided I get the first strike."" \n\n""The first strike?"" I murmured. ""So you must never be surprised."" \n\nThat is why I came to you,"" said Movarth. ""You know more than anyone alive about these monsters, with all their cursed types across the land. Now you must tell me about the vampires of northern Valenwood."" \n\nI did as he asked, and once again, his questions were very taxing. There were many tribes to cover. The Bonsamu who were indistinguishable from Bosmer except when seen by candlelight. The Keerilth who could turn into mist. The Yekef who swallowed men whole. The dreaded Telboth who preyed on children, eventually taking their place in the family, waiting patiently for years before murdering them all in their unnatural hunger. \n\nOnce again, he bade me farewell, promising to return in a few weeks, and once again, he returned as he said, just after midnight. This time, Movarth had no fresh scars, but he again had new information. \n\n""You were wrong about the Keerilth being unable to vaporize when pushed underwater,"" he said, patting my shoulder fondly. ""Fortunately, they cannot travel far in their mist form and I was able to track them down."" \n\n""I must have surprised it. Your field knowledge is becoming impressive,"" I said. ""I should have had an acolyte like you decades ago."" \n\n""Now, tell me,"" he said. ""Of the vampires of Cyrodiil."" \n\nI told him what I could. There was but one tribe in Cyrodiil, a powerful clan who had ousted all other competitors, much like the Imperials themselves had done. Their true name was unknown, lost to history, but they were experts at concealment. If they kept themselves well-fed, they were indistinguishable from living persons. They were cultured, more civilized than the vampires of the other provinces, preferring to feed on victims while they were asleep, unaware. \n\n""They will be difficult to surprise,"" Movarth frowned. ""But I will seek one out and tell you what I learn. And then you will tell me of the vampires of High Rock, and Hammerfell, and Elsweyr, and Black Marsh, and Morrowind, and the Summerset Isles, yes?"" \n\nI nodded, knowing then that this was a man on an eternal quest. He wouldn't be satisfied with he finished his task. He needed to know it all. \n\nHe did not return for a month, and on the night that he did, I could see his frustration and despair, though there were no lights burning in my chapel. \n\n""I failed,"" he said, as I lit a candle. ""You were right. I could not find a single one."" \n\nI brought the light up to my face and smiled. He was surprised, even stunned by the pallor of my flesh, the dark hunger in my ageless eyes, and the teeth. Oh, yes, I think the teeth definitely surprised the man who could not afford to be surprised. \n\n""I haven't fed in seventy-two hours,"" I explained, as I fell on him. He did not land the first blow or the last."

Dialog_Vault_103,Wait......Wh...What is this message?
Dialog_Vault_104,What! It......Oh! No! Stop it now!
Dialog_Vault_105,Darn it! This thing won't stop......
Dialog_Vault_125,"Oh no, oh no! There's only a few minutes left......I have to think of something, otherwise everyone in the Vault will suffer!"
Dialog_Vault_126,......I have no other choice......
Dialog_Vault_127,I hope everyone will forgive me.
Dialog_Vault_128,"Goodbye Vault, wishing everyone only the best!"
Dialog_Vault_106,This is a disaster! How did the Vault door open?! The Overseer is missing! The Resource Purifier is missing too! A rookie is taking over the Vault! Lord save us... we're doomed...
Dialog_Vault_107,Ah!!!
Dialog_Vault_108,Who... who are you? Wh... what do you want?
Dialog_Vault_109,"Hi there, don't be scared. We are the Minutemen, we mean you no harm. We were just passing by and heard some ruckus, so we decided to take a look."
Dialog_Vault_110,"Relax, we're not Raiders. If you need help, we can provide some assistance... looks like there's something wrong with your Vault."
Dialog_Vault_111,"How about this? My partner, Sturges, is an engineer. He should be able to help."
Dialog_Vault_112,"Sure thing. If it is in fact an engineering issue, I'm sure I can handle it."

Dialog_Vault_115,So... you're not Raiders?
Dialog_Vault_116,"Raider? Me? Well my lady, you ever seen a Raider that also happens to be an excellent handyman?"
Dialog_Vault_117,What are you doing now...?
Dialog_Vault_118,I'm checking your door. How can a lady like you live with the door wide open? Am I right?
Dialog_Vault_119,Did you figure out the problem with the door?
Dialog_Vault_120,"The door itself is not damaged, but the circuitry has burn marks. No big deal, I can fix it in a jiffy."
Dialog_Vault_121,Al... alright...
Dialog_Vault_122,You should upgrade this door to ensure circuitry issues like this don't happen again. It's for your own safety.
Dialog_Vault_123,Okay...
Dialog_Vault_124,"Done! Give it a try, close the door!"

Dialog_Level5010110_109,Watch yourself! There are lot of irradiated monsters ahead. Attacking them head-on is too risky.

Dialog_Level5010110_111,"We got lucky with our shots, otherwise, we'd be lunch by now."
Dialog_Level5010110_112,Hey. I came when I heard gunshots. What happened?

Dialog_Level5010110_114,And you didn't wait for me?!
Dialog_Level5010110_115,Ronnie said there is a storage room down the stairs to the right. Maybe there are some resources we can use there.
Dialog_Level5010110_116,Woah......that was close!
Dialog_Level5010110_117,It was an emergency decision. It's a miracle we survived with our outdated equipment!
Dialog_Level5010110_118,This......This 'big fella' is a Deathclaw! It's the most dangerous creature in the Wasteland! An apex predator!
Dialog_Level5010110_119,"Hmm..... True. If we want to survive the Wasteland, we need better equipment. You have to learn to utilize rubbish to make your wears more durable."
Dialog_Level5010110_120,"Head back and regroup, then meet me at the Concord Workhouse."
Dialog_Level2010100_101,"You have to pass through Sanctuary Hills if you travel from the Vault to the Commonwealth. We should start looking here, no matter who you're trying to find."
Dialog_Level2010100_102,Wow! Preston! You remembered its name! I only remember that there was a group of Triggermen running after us the last time we were here......
Dialog_Level2010100_103,Of course. It's a shame that those Triggermen have holed up here in Sanctuary Hills. This person we need to find... what's his name again?
Dialog_Level2010100_104,"Jacob March, the Vault's Overseer."
Dialog_Level2010100_105,"Right, if Jacob passed through here, he would probably have been captured by the Triggermen."
Dialog_Level2010100_106,Oh! That's not good... Being a prisoner of the Triggermen doesn't usually end well.
Dialog_Level2010100_107,Try not to think about it. Let's push forward.
Dialog_Level2010100_201,"Wait, did you hear something?"
Dialog_Level2010100_202,Help! Help!!
Dialog_Level2010100_203,"A woman's voice, I thought we were looking for an old man......"
Dialog_Level2010100_204,"It came from up ahead. Sturges, cover me! I'll go check."
Dialog_Level2010100_301,Thank God! I thought I was dead! You guys......don't look any better than the Raiders.
Dialog_Level2010100_302,"The people you are calling ""no better than the Raiders"" just saved your life, so you're welcome."
Dialog_Level2010100_303,"Sorry, you don't know what I've been through."
Dialog_Level2010100_304,"Head outside and follow the road if you need help, you'll see a Vault, you'll be safe there."
Dialog_Level2010100_305,Sounds good. I'll head there now.
Dialog_Level2010100_401,We're at a dead end. It's a shame we didn't see your Overseer......What's his name again?
Dialog_Level2010100_402,Jacob March
Dialog_Level2010100_403,"That's right. There's no trace of him, but he couldn't have gone far. Sturges, you should head back and get some rest. I'll take another look around."
Dialog_Level2010100_404,"No problem, you're the boss."
Dialog_Level2010200_101,"The Red Rocket..... Rumor has it, it was the most popular gas station and repair shop in the Commonwealth. It being so popular, Jacob most likely would've fueled up here? Hahahaha."
Dialog_Level2010200_102,Was that supposed to be a joke?
Dialog_Level2010200_103,Yeah. Why you ask?
Dialog_Level2010200_104,I seriously don't think it's funny......
Dialog_Level2010200_201,"Oh! So many disgusting Mole Rats! This is why I don't like the surface, no matter how thick your protection is, there's always something wanting to sink its teeth in you."
Dialog_Level2010200_202,Woof woof!
Dialog_Level2010200_203,A wild dog! I better shoot it...
Dialog_Level2010200_204,"Wait! Don't shoot! Dogmeat, is that you? We thought you lost us, bud. How did you find us here?"
Dialog_Level2010200_205,Woof Woof Woof!
Dialog_Level2010200_206,Good boy! Come with me.
Dialog_Level2010200_401,What the hell......
Dialog_Level2010200_402,Woof Woof Woof!
Dialog_Level2010200_403,"Oh, Dogmeat, what did you find?"
Dialog_Level2010200_404,You seem to have a lot of trust in this dog. Is there something special about him?
Dialog_Level2010200_405,"Of course! Dogmeat is our best friend, he has helped us out of danger multiple times."
Dialog_Level2010200_406,Woof!
Dialog_Level2010200_407,Look ahead! An albino female Mole Rat! This is probably the second ugliest thing I've seen on the surface.
Dialog_Level2010200_408,Second ugliest? What's the ugliest then?
Dialog_Level2010200_409,You.
Dialog_Level2010200_410,Hey!
Dialog_Level2010200_411,"We tracked Jacob's beacon here, but I don't see him. You don't think he was eaten by that female Mole Rat, do you?"
Dialog_Level2010200_412,"Impossible. Mole rats like to attack people, but their appetites are not that big."
Dialog_Level2010200_413,Your knowledge of Mole Rats is impressive. I thought you didn't like them.
Dialog_Level2010200_414,Of course I don't like them! But that's not the point. Let's see if Dogmeat finds a lead here.
Dialog_Level2010200_415,"(Sniffs around, shakes his head)"
Dialog_Level2010200_416,"Looks like luck isn't on our side today, let's go back to the Vault to recharge."
Dialog_Level2010300_101,"Okay, you're here. They should have what we're looking for."
Dialog_Level2010300_102,Why would there be anything useful here? There's just trash and used materials!
Dialog_Level2010300_103,"They see it as trash, I see it as treasure. My Father once told me, trash is the cornerstone of our generation's civilization."
Dialog_Level2010300_104,"When we get back, I'd be happy to do a full medical test on your brain."
Dialog_Level2010300_105,"Okay Okay, we need to hurry up. There are a lot of Raiders and scavengers around, and they're not very friendly."
Dialog_Level2010300_106,I can't believe it. These Raiders actually use trash to enhance their weapons!
Dialog_Level2010300_107,"That's right! When we get back, we can also re-use trash to enhance our own equipment."
Dialog_Level2010300_108,"Don't get ahead of yourself, it's dangerous out here. I don't want to wait around for more of them to show up."
Dialog_Level2010300_109,"Ronnie, don't be so serious all the time. I'll buy you a drink once we get back!"
Dialog_Level5010700_101,"So......Mrs. Filmore, why are we in this old church? This should be my lunch break, I haven't even finished my coffee yet!"
Dialog_Level5010700_102,"While you were busy hammering on that garbage equipment, I upgraded my data acquisition unit. Now I can use it to collect data on various mutant creatures for my experiments."
Dialog_Level5010700_103,"Sounds cool, but what do I have anything to do with it?"
Dialog_Level5010700_104,"Well.... the best data comes from close-contact with the mutant creatures, right...?"
Dialog_Level5010700_105,What? Wait......
Dialog_Level5010700_106,"(Machine clicks) Look, all done! Relax my friend, I have a feeling that you'll be a great collector."
Dialog_Level5010700_107,Mrs. Filmore... don't you have enough data already? It still hurts where the Mole Rats bit me.
Dialog_Level5010700_108,"Shh, careful, there's a strong biological signal ahead, this means there's more data waiting for us."
Dialog_Level5010700_109,"Mrs. Filmore......This should be enough, all of my bones are aching......"
Dialog_Level5010700_110,"What are you talking about? Our experiment has just started. Look at the Commonwealth, there are so many opportunities, so many experiments, don't you think it's exciting?"
Dialog_Level5010700_111,I'd rather you shoot me......
Dialog_Level5010700_112,"Oh shhh......sweetie, I won't let you die that easily."
Dialog_Level5010600_101,Preston! We're here! We heard you found something?
Dialog_Level5010600_102,That's correct! Ronnie and I were collecting resources for our camp at the Museum of Freedom when we came across something unexpected...
Dialog_Level5010600_103,"Come, I'll take you to it, it's still how we found it. Also, Dogmeat may be of some help. Bring him along."
Dialog_Level5010600_104,(Excited) Woof!
Dialog_Level5010600_105,"We're here, it's over there."
Dialog_Level5010600_106,This......This is......
Dialog_Level5010600_107,"That's right, this is a Vault Suit from your Vault. Looks like your......uh......"
Dialog_Level5010600_108,Jacob March
Dialog_Level5010600_109,Yes! Looks like he doesn't want to be found.
Dialog_Level5010600_110,"But we have Dogmeat! Come on boy, it's your time to shine!"
Dialog_Level5010600_111,Woof woof. (Sniff sniff) Woof!
Dialog_Level5010600_112,"Dogmeat should be able to lead you to Jacob by tracking his scent. So, let's head back to regroup."
Dialog_Level5010300_101,This is the Starlight Drive-In? Sad they're not showing any films right now.
Dialog_Level5010300_102,"This reminds me of when I was little, I loved watching horror films. There was a film in the Institute's archive, it was about giant bugs attacking humans, it was my childhood nightmare."
Dialog_Level5010300_103,Umm......Are you sure you're talking about films? There's a massive bug wanting to attack us right now......
Dialog_Level5010300_104,It's ironic isn't it? Are you ready for data collection?
Dialog_Level5010300_105,These bugs are seriously disgusting......I don't think I'll be able to eat for a few days.
Dialog_Level5010300_106,"Be positive my friend, it would be cool if your heroic fight with the bug just now was made into a film."
Dialog_Level5010300_107,"It would be a terrible film, the audience would be asking for a refund!"
Dialog_Level5010300_108,"Don't be so sure, the audience's taste changes all the time."
Dialog_Level5010300_109,"Ha-ha, really funny."
Dialog_Level3010200_101,"Brilliant! We're collecting data again. Look at these Mirelurks, they look so gross. Much to your liking I can only imagine!"
Dialog_Level3010200_102,"For once, you're right. I once had a Mirelurk Fritter. Best thing in the entire Wasteland!"
Dialog_Level3010200_103,"You're joking, look how dirty they are, how could they taste good?"
Dialog_Level3010200_104,"You should taste it for yourself! Look, those 'cute' Mirelurks are coming this way."
Dialog_Level3010200_105,"Honestly, I'm starting to like these ""data collections, "" Allie. It's painful most of the time, but if it means we get to have a delicious Mirelurk Fritters for dinner, it's all worth it."
Dialog_Level3010200_106,"I don't buy it, I'll never try your suspicious fritters!"
Dialog_Level3010200_107,Suit yourself!
Dialog_Level5011000_101,"Okay friends, as usual, we're going to collect some fresh, exciting data!"
Dialog_Level5011000_102,What monsters are we going to encounter this time?
Dialog_Level5011000_103,"This is weird, the lifesigns are showing it's a group of......squirrels? Have you seen squirrels in the Wasteland?"
Dialog_Level5011000_104,Churrchurr...gee! Chitter!
Dialog_Level5011000_105,What's with these Raiders?
Dialog_Level5011000_106,Churrchitter.
Dialog_Level5011000_107,"This is interesting, my detector says these Raiders are...uh...squirrels. Darn it, is this thing broken?"
Dialog_Level5011000_108,(Unusually excited) Woof! Woof!
Dialog_Level5011000_109,(Scared) CHITTERCHIRP!
Dialog_Level5011000_110,"Great, the Raiders are definitely squirrels. Looks how excited Dogmeat is!"
Dialog_Level5011000_111,"That's a shame, the data we collected is very limited. Guess we'll never know why these Raiders see themselves as squirrels......or why these squirrels became Raiders."
Dialog_Level5011000_112,Another unsolved mystery in the wild Wasteland! But at least Dogmeat looks happy.
Dialog_Level5011000_113,Woof!
Dialog_Level6010300_101,Didn't realize we're at Waldon Lake already... is Dogmeat's sense of smell really this good?
Dialog_Level6010300_102,Woof! Woof!
Dialog_Level6010300_103,Looks like some other smell is distracting Dogmeat......
Dialog_Level6010300_104,"Oh......Not just Dogmeat, even I can't take this smell, look at those stinking Mirelurks!"
Dialog_Level6010300_105,Get rid of them quickly. We don't have time to waste!
Dialog_Level6010300_106,"Throw them in the lake, Dogmeat's sense of smell should recover."
Dialog_Level6010300_107,Woof!
Dialog_Level6010300_108,"Did you know that Henry David Thoureau used to live here? A 19th century writer, he believed that we could see the essence of the world through observing nature, a thought that predated his time!"
Dialog_Level6010300_109,"Although many years have passed and people have a greater knowledge of the world, we still haven't manage to avoid the destruction of civilization. Oh sweet irony!"
Dialog_Level6010300_110,"No time for lamenting, we must keep moving."
Dialog_Level3010300_101,"Hi Preston, we came as quickly as we could."
Dialog_Level3010300_102,"Good timing, I did some digging, but keep an eye out our Raider friends should be giving us some surprises."
Dialog_Level3010300_103,Surprises? What surprises?
Dialog_Level3010300_104,"You'll find out soon, don't you like a little mystery?"
Dialog_Level3010300_105,I hate mysteries!
Dialog_Level3010300_106,"It's in here, these Raiders robbed our battle supply team not long ago, now these supplies can finally be returned to their rightful owner."
Dialog_Level3010300_107,"Wait, this is the so called ""surprise?"" We went through all that trouble just for a hat?"
Dialog_Level3010300_108,Don't you like it though?
Dialog_Level3010300_109,This hat is old enough to be an antique! Who would like something like that?
Dialog_Level3010300_110,"I quite like it to tell you the truth, the brim design should suit my hairstyle pretty well......"
Dialog_Level3010300_111,"(Touches forehead, lets out a long sigh)"
Dialog_Level3010300_112,"Okay, let's get out of here. Regarding battle supplies, there's something I need to tell you."
Dialog_Level2010400_101,"You're finally here. Listen, a group of Raiders took Mama Murphy, we need to rescue her as soon as possible."
Dialog_Level2010400_102,Why would the Raiders kidnap a random old grandma?
Dialog_Level2010400_103,"Mama Murphy has the...... gift of foresight, and it has helped us a lot before. These Raiders probably heard about it and think Mama Murphy is the reincarnation of some kind of god......"
Dialog_Level2010400_104,"Doesn't sound too bad, maybe Mama Murphy can enjoy herself.... being considered a god and all."
Dialog_Level2010400_105,The problem is that they want to sacrifice her to their 'true god'......that doesn't sound good.
Dialog_Level2010400_106,Surrender! You're surrounded.
Dialog_Level2010400_107,"We will never yield! The bread machine god has gifted us with power! He gave us the daughter with foresight, you cannot stop our ceremony!"
Dialog_Level2010400_108,"Sorry, I want to be clear: You worship a bread machine?"
Dialog_Level2010400_109,"You don't know a thing about the bread machine god! His fire will burn across the Wasteland in due time, all we need to do is give him a seer—and of course that cowardly Ghoul!"
Dialog_Level2010400_110,Why is it that all of the Raiders we have come across are bonkers?
Dialog_Level2010400_111,"Thank you, I knew you would come."
Dialog_Level2010400_112,Why do you look so calm?
Dialog_Level2010400_113,"I saw all of this with my Sight. So I've been comforting my new Ghoul friend, but he doesn't believe in my abilities."
Dialog_Level2010400_114,"Well, I do now! Ahem, let me introduce myself. Name's Tommy. I'm the manager of the Wasteland Arena 'battlefield', thank you for saving me."
Dialog_Level2010400_115,"You're welcome! Hey, can you give us some free tickets to the battlefield?"
Dialog_Level2010400_116,"Saving me is worth more than just a few tickets, I can provide you with an opportunity......a stage that will make you famous."
Dialog_Level2010400_117,"I will have my people contact you. Now, please allow this scared old Ghoul to go home and rest."
Dialog_Level5010900_101,Hel......Help......
Dialog_Level5010900_102,"Ha! What a good timing, we rescued a hostage the second we got here."
Dialog_Level5010900_103,"Please! He came running himself, we didn't save him."
Dialog_Level5010900_104,There's no difference. Look at those raiders in the back. There would be a rescue scene sooner or later.
Dialog_Level5010900_105,Help! Help!
Dialog_Level5010900_106,"Don't panic old man, hide behind there and watch us kick those Raiders' butts."
Dialog_Level5010900_107,Uh...ok...
Dialog_Level5010900_108,"How was it? Was it a good show? Judging from your expressions, I'm starting to think that I should ask for some performance fees."
Dialog_Level5010900_109,"Ok ok! Thank you for saving me, I'm a very famous merchant, I'm very rich!"
Dialog_Level5010900_110,What? He says he's rich......I'm thinking about kidnapping him now......
Dialog_Level5010900_111,"Alright, stop kidding around, we need to make our way back to the Vault after this task."
Dialog_Level5010900_112,"So, this... uh, old man. You shouldn't stay here any longer. Go find a safe route home."
Dialog_Level5010900_113,Okay Okay! Thank you very much! But you said you're going back to the Vault?
Dialog_Level5010900_114,"Yeah, is there a problem?"
Dialog_Level5010900_115,"No problem, no problem! The Vault is good! You know, I'm a merchant, I like to do business with Vaults, why don't you give me your means of contact......"
Dialog_Level5010900_116,I will contact you once you're back at the Vault! You'll be pleased doing business with me! I promise! Wait for my message!
Dialog_Level5010900_117,Hmm......It feels like we aren't on the same page......
Dialog_Level8010100_101,Are you ready my friends? Another exciting adventure is about to begin!
Dialog_Level8010100_102,What dangerous creatures will we anger this time?
Dialog_Level8010100_103,"Hmm... there's a lot of signal interference here... but one thing's for sure... there is a very dangerous biological signal hidden deep in this abandoned supermarket, quietly waiting for us."
Dialog_Level8010100_104,Biological signal? All I can see are a bunch of salebots that have no job......defeating them wouldn't offer any satisfaction.
Dialog_Level8010100_105,But we can liberate them from an unlimited cycle of organizing a supermarket with no customers. Does this count as satisfaction?
Dialog_Level8010100_106,Is this where that dangerous signal is coming from? I can hear something inside.
Dialog_Level8010100_107,"I think so, be careful, the signal shows that it's a Feral Ghoul."
Dialog_Level8010100_108,It's saying something? Listen! It's saying......Ice cream?!
Dialog_Level8010100_109,What? We're not ice cream!
Dialog_Level8010100_110,"Weird guy. Mrs. Filmore, what do you think of our big, green, stinky Ghoul friend here?"
Dialog_Level8010100_111,"Umm......judging from the ice cream boxes scattered around him and his bloated body, this dude has been trapped here since the disaster."
Dialog_Level8010100_112,Since then he's been surviving on the massive storage of ice cream here......until he lost his sanity and became a brainless Ghoul.
Dialog_Level8010100_113,"Poor thing. Look, it has a name tag: 'Freezer Administrator: Simon Frost', looks like it used to work here."
Dialog_Level8010100_114,"Rest in peace, Simon. Eating this much ice cream before death counts as a ""sweet"" ending, doesn't it?"
Dialog_Level8010410_101,Hey look! What are those Raiders doing?
Dialog_Level8010410_102,(Hitting the mutant dog) Bite here! Bite here!
Dialog_Level8010410_103,They're torturing that dog into becoming a bloodthirsty machine!
Dialog_Level8010410_104,"You're right, who would care about a dog in this apocalyptic world? It's only reason for existing is to become our weapon!"
Dialog_Level8010410_105,I can't agree to that!
Dialog_Level8010410_106,You're too late. Snowball! Get them!
Dialog_Level8010410_107,"We're too late, letting it rest in peace is the only option."
Dialog_Level8010410_108,What the Raiders said is not entirely without reason. Everyone has to find a way to survive out on the Wasteland. Their way just happens to be torture and violence.
Dialog_Level8010410_109,It's still not right. I hope the 'family heirloom' we're looking for was not this dog.
Dialog_Level8010410_110,"I'm sure our mysterious friend has been following us. They haven't made an appearance yet, that means our mission continues."
Dialog_Level8010300_101,"I like this place. The clashing of machines, the smell of the mixture of engine oil and diesel oil, it blends into a beautiful melody."
Dialog_Level8010300_103,"I know, but doesn't diesel and engine oil sound more romantic?"
Dialog_Level8010300_104,"I'm guessing the Raiders here have the same taste as you, you might even be lifelong friends."
Dialog_Level8010300_105,If they don't greet us with bullets that is.
Dialog_Level8010300_106,How dare you intrude into the holy birthplace of Corvega! Get ready to be punished by the metal!
Dialog_Level8010300_107,I like this guy!
Dialog_Level8010300_108,(Rolls eyes) Why are you so into these pieces of broken metal?
Dialog_Level8010300_109,"Pieces of broken metal? Soon enough, we will clean sweep Boston Harbor with a brand new Corvega, everyone will bend their knees: the Undying Car!"
Dialog_Level8010300_110,And you will be the first victims of my great journey by insulting the divine Corvega!
Dialog_Level8010300_111,"Hey, I thought we could be friends! Now we have to kill you......"
Dialog_Level8010300_112,"Hahahahaha, my bones are made of alloy! Diesel runs through my veins! You will never defeat me!"
Dialog_Level8010300_113,"It's just blood and bones, he's not as strong as he thinks he is."
Dialog_Level8010300_114,"That's a pity, I'm starting to see that if these Raiders weren't so crazy, they wouldn't come off as so cynical."
Dialog_Level8010300_115,"You need to stop being so sentimental, let's focus on why we're here. Did you see anything that looked like a family heirloom?"
Dialog_Force_20213_101,This is where the SOS signal is coming from. Who could be sending the signals? Could it be Jacob?
Dialog_Force_20213_102,Who's Jacob?
Dialog_Force_20213_103,(Looks around nervously) Who's talking?
Dialog_Force_20213_104,"Relax, stranger, relax, I won't eat you."
Dialog_Force_20213_105,Are you the one that's been sending the signal? You've been watching us?
Dialog_Force_20213_106,"I......need your help with a small favor. You look like nice travelers, surely you won't say no to a poor Wastelander."
Dialog_Force_20213_107,"That depends on the favor you're asking. Why are you hiding? Come and meet us, we can protect you."
Dialog_Force_20213_108,"I...I'm very ugly! Yes, I'm ugly, I don't want to startle you. I...I am going to keep my distance!"
Dialog_Force_20213_109,(Lowered voice) Sounds suspicious.
Dialog_Force_20213_110,What do you want us to do?
Dialog_Force_20213_111,"The Raiders nearby stole my...my family heirloom, but I can't confirm their identities. If you happen to find it on a Raider and return it, I would be very grateful!"
Dialog_Force_20213_112,What's your family heirloom?
Dialog_Force_20213_113,You'll know when you see it.
Dialog_Force_20213_114,Lexington mansion is ours! Get out!
Dialog_Force_20213_115,"I'm curious, why did Raiders like you take over this mansion? Obviously there aren't any resources of interest."
Dialog_Force_20213_116,"It's called planning for the future! After the Wasteland civilization has been rebuilt, the rise in population would definitely increase demand in housing. We could rent the mansion out for a very high price to those who need it. We will be rich!"
Dialog_Force_20213_117,"Sounds like a good plan, but Boston's population won't increase enough in the next hundred years. Trust me, I've done the calculations."
Dialog_Force_20213_118,What? No! Impossible!
Dialog_Force_20213_119,These Raiders' investment in housing was a complete failure.
Dialog_Force_20213_120,"Of course, we can't let Wastelanders' living space be occupied by a bunch of Raiders."
Dialog_Force_20213_121,There's nothing of interest on them. The thing we're looking for is probably elsewhere.
Dialog_Force_20213_122,I just hope this is not another trap......that 'ugly' guy sounded very suspicious.
Dialog_Level6010100_101,Huh? Preston? Why are you here too?
Dialog_Level6010100_102,"Oh, nearby settlers tasked me to find some resources here."
Dialog_Level6010100_103,"What a coincidence, we are looking for signs of the Ex-Overseer and maybe collect come materials along the way."
Dialog_Level6010100_104,Let's work together.
Dialog_Level6010100_105,No problem!
Dialog_Level6010100_106,"The battle just now... Even though there were no issues, I feel like you're missing something."
Dialog_Level6010100_107,Huh? What do you mean?
Dialog_Level6010100_108,Your combat skills seem to be the same as when you first started... I think I know why.
Dialog_Level6010100_109,"You haven't done the combat PERK training, right?"
Dialog_Level6010100_110,Umm...? What is that...?
Dialog_Level6010100_111,"Heh, that's okay. I'll tell you after we leave here."
Dialog_Level7010100_101,(Alarmed) Woof! Woof!
Dialog_Level7010100_102,Dogmeat found something! Follow him!
Dialog_Level7010100_103,Who is it!
Dialog_Level7010100_104,......
Dialog_Level7010100_105,Put down your weapons or you'll be sorry!
Dialog_Level7010100_106,Wait! Stop! This is not our enemy... What are you doing here Kellogg?
Dialog_Level7010100_107,"Allie? What a coincidence! I've got some errands to run. I can't give you any details, but maybe we can work together temporarily."
Dialog_Level7010100_108,"Oh......you know each other, that's great."
Dialog_Level7010100_109,"Ha, that's great, the Institute keeping its lips sealed, as always I see."
Dialog_Level7010100_110,(Shakes head confused)
Dialog_Level7010100_111,"There are probably too many different scents. Dogmeat has lost it. Good boy, you did your best!"
Dialog_Level7010100_112,Let's take a look around. Maybe we'll find something.
Dialog_Level7010100_113,Looks like we've lost our lead...
Dialog_Level7010100_114,What should we do? Give up just like that?
Dialog_Level7010100_115,"Or, you can go to Diamond City. You can usually find some news about the Commonwealth Wasteland there. Plus, there's a famous detective, a Synthetic Human (Synth) named Nick Valentine."
Dialog_Level7010100_116,"I don't really like him, but he should be able to help you."
Dialog_Level7010100_117,What next?
Dialog_Level7010100_118,"First, find the route to Diamond City. Then, we find Nick Valentine."
Dialog_Leve16010500_101,Thank you for your support. The number of Ghouls here is frightening.
Dialog_Leve16010500_102,Maybe they're all waiting for the next train to hell.
Dialog_Leve16010500_103,"Oh, I get it. The point of that joke is that this is an underground station. Very interesting soldier.."
Dialog_Leve16010500_104,"Danse, you just killed the mood."
Dialog_Leve16010500_105,"Uh, I don't understand......"
Dialog_Leve16010500_106,"Never try to explain a joke, Paladin"
Dialog_Leve16010500_107,"Danse, remind me, why are we here?"
Dialog_Leve16010500_108,"To investigate and collect unused technical data, soldier. Is there something wrong?"
Dialog_Leve16010500_109,"All I see is a train that's 200 years late, no wonder there are so many Ghouls here! Sadly, the day they're waiting for will never arrive."
Dialog_Leve16010500_110,"I'm sure the data we want is here......wait a moment, soldier, did you just tell a joke?"
Dialog_Leve16010500_111,(Holding back a laugh) Did I?
Dialog_Leve16010500_112,"Haha, looks like Paladin from the Brotherhood of steel isn't capable of everything."
Dialog_Leve16010500_113,Found it! This is the technical Document we need.
Dialog_Leve16010500_114,Let me see......This Document recorded somewhat useful information.
Dialog_Leve16010500_115,"This information is helpful to the Brotherhood......I remember that you're looking for a Resource Purifier for the Vault, it's a shame there's nothing about that in this document."
Dialog_Leve16010500_116,"The Wasteland is covered with relentless monsters, so you not only have to work on your combat skills, but also make long term plans. Try and see if you can find other technologies that can replace the Resource Purifier."
Dialog_Leve16010500_117,"Thanks for your suggestion. Good luck, Paladin!"
Dialog_Leve16010100_101,Where's my backup? These Super Mutants are too strong!
Dialog_Leve16010100_102,Need any help?
Dialog_Leve16010100_103,"Yes......Wait, you're not from the Brotherhood. What are a group of civilians doing here? It's very dangerous, leave now!"
Dialog_Leve16010100_104,We can protect ourselves and it looks like you could use our help. Now's not the time to dwell on the fact that we're civilians.
Dialog_Leve16010100_105,"Ok......but be careful. Super mutants are powerful. They're also crazy, making them even more dangerous."
Dialog_Leve16010100_106,Your combat skills surprised me. It's hard to believe that you're untrained civilians.
Dialog_Leve16010100_107,"Let me introduce myself formally. I'm Paladin Danse from the Western Brotherhood of Steel (BoS), number DN-407P, I salute you!"
Dialog_Leve16010100_108,Brotherhood of steel. Cool name!
Dialog_Leve16010100_109,"Yeah it is. If you're interested, the Brotherhood would welcome experienced soldiers like yourselves."
Dialog_Leve16010100_110,"But let's save that for later, the Super Mutants are still very active. The Brotherhood must set up a defense system before they can reorganize themselves."
Dialog_Leve16010100_111,"Thanks for your help, see you soon."
Dialog_Leve7010200_101,"Soldiers, you're late."
Dialog_Leve7010200_102,We're hardly late...
Dialog_Leve7010200_103,Even one second can mean the difference between life and death in battle. Don't forget that.
Dialog_Leve7010200_104,Ok. What's our mission this time?
Dialog_Leve7010200_105,"As usual, clearing out this area and searching for anything of value, like technical documents."
Dialog_Leve7010200_106,"The difference here is that the place is covered with Synths produced by the Institute, maybe they're after the same thing as us. We need to clear this place and unroot the Institute's influence here."
Dialog_Leve7010200_107,It seems the Brotherhood really hates the Institute and their Synths. Why is that?
Dialog_Leve7010200_108,"Like Ghouls and Super Mutants, Synths are the byproducts of the overuse of technology. Their very existence is an insult to humans, what's worse is that Synths have been used to execute the Institute's dirty business."
Dialog_Leve7010200_109,Synths must be destroyed!
Dialog_Leve7010200_110,"I don't quite understand, but I suddenly feel a sense of calling."
Dialog_Leve7010200_111,"These Synths are just robots following simple orders, are they really that dangerous?"
Dialog_Leve7010200_112,"These are only the first and second models. From the intel we have collected, it's the third generation model that presents the biggest threat."
Dialog_Leve7010200_113,"They are just like humans, they even have human memories, some of them don't even know they are Synths—and this fear of the unknown is what really makes them so dangerous."
Dialog_Leve7010200_114,That gives me the chills. Do you think there's a Synth with us right now?
Dialog_Leve7010200_115,"It's possible, but only the Institute knows the answer to that, my friend. This is why the Brotherhood became enemies with the Institute; the fear and chaos caused by their reckless use of technology is a threat to everyone."
Dialog_Leve7010200_116,"I will remember that, Paladin."
Dialog_Leve7010200_117,"Looks like we are in luck, we found the Documents before the Synths."
Dialog_Leve7010200_118,"This Document......records how to build an efficient radar module with a simple component......Beacon Oscillator, Frequency Multiplier, X-5 Antenna......everything we need for radar communication."
Dialog_Leve7010200_119,"As before, thinking strategically, you should use this opportunity to build a Radar Room. Scanning the Wasteland for unused resources can bring you a greater strategic advantage."
Dialog_Leve7010200_120,Sounds like a good plan!
Dialog_Leve7010200_121,"The Brotherhood is happy to work with you, soldier, we will see you soon."
Dialog_Leve16010300_101,"Danse, what kind of trouble is waiting for us now?"
Dialog_Leve16010300_102,"Oh, you know. Green, big, stupid. That kind of trouble."
Dialog_Leve16010300_103,"Ok, but why did they take over this abandoned Institute? There's nothing they would want here."
Dialog_Leve16010300_104,"There are a lot of books, aren't there? Maybe these green monsters think eating books would give their brains a boost."
Dialog_Leve16010300_105,"Hahaha that's a good one......wait Danse, you actually told a joke!"
Dialog_Leve16010300_106,This is a new experience for me......
Dialog_Leve16010300_107,"Guys, can you discuss your abilities in the field of humor later? A group of greenies are surrounding us!"
Dialog_Leve16010300_108,"Found it, this is the technical Document we need, maybe these Documents are too ...DRY for these monsters."
Dialog_Leve16010300_109,"Ok geez. You can't stop now, Mr. Paladin."
Dialog_Leve16010300_110,These Documents explain how to make battle gear with a simple set up. Looks very valuable.
Dialog_Leve16010300_111,"That's right, better equipment means stronger combat abilities. A good logistical strategy is the key to winning, you should build a tool workshop, soldier."
Dialog_Leve16010300_112,"We will, Danse."
Dialog_Leve16010300_113,"Great, we have completed our technical scouting in this area. We will contact you if we need you, see you soon, soldier!"
Dialog_Leve16010300_114,See you soon.
Dialog_Level16010600_101,"Hmm, what is this?"
Dialog_Level16010600_102,Looks like......a ragged magazine.
Dialog_Level16010600_103,"Let me see......Shoot, this magazine has been gnawed by Ghouls, it's unreadable."
Dialog_Level16010600_104,"Look at the bottom of the cover, there's a signature that's barely visible. Moira.B......who is this?"
Dialog_Level16010600_105,"Moira·B......That's Moira Brown, the author of the famous 'Wasteland survival guide' magazine! Looks like this is a signed copy, it's a pity that it's unreadable now."
Dialog_Level16010600_106,"Don't worry, it seems this magazine is very popular in Boston, maybe we'll come across another one in the future."
Dialog_Level16010600_107,"I hope so, I'm her biggest fan!"
Dialog_Level17010100_101,This is Oberland Station. We should arrive at Diamond City after passing through.
Dialog_Level17010100_102,What a giant effort to find the Ex-Overseer. I even have dreams about digging holes trying to find him.
Dialog_Level17010100_103,Maybe your dreams are an omen... maybe he is dead. Somewhere we don't know about.
Dialog_Level17010100_104,Shut your trap. We already have enough to worry about. Do you really want to search heaven AND earth?
Dialog_Level17010100_105,He must be in Diamond City! Let's go now!
Dialog_Level17010300_101,"So, you promise this is the last experiment? I don't want to be licked by weird mutant creatures again......"
Dialog_Level17010300_102,"Don't worry, I only need a little more data for my experiment. I'll be able to finish my essay when we get back, how exciting! This will be a memorable day!"
Dialog_Level17010300_103,Ahem......I have to responsibly remind you that most people on the Wasteland probably don't even know what 'essay' means.
Dialog_Level17010300_104,Let me worry about that. Let's get started! Are you ready for our final data collection?
Dialog_Level17010300_105,Do we have to collect it in a dirty underground sewer? I bet the Mirelurks here are no different than anywhere else...
Dialog_Level17010300_106,"Believe me, I don't want to be here any more than you do, but my stats show there are special mutants here."
Dialog_Level17010300_107,I'll never understand why you scientists take statistics so seriously. What I see is what I believe.
Dialog_Level17010300_108,"What can you believe in if you can't even believe in statistics? Scientists predicted the disaster by calculating statistics 200 years ago, but no one believed it, and look where we are now."
Dialog_Level17010300_109,"Uh...Calm down, calm down, no need to get riled up over this."
Dialog_Level17010300_110,"All done, this should be enough data."
Dialog_Level17010300_111,Really?! My painful journey has finally come to an end!
Dialog_Level17010300_112,"Wait, don't you find this Mirelurk a bit strange?"
Dialog_Level17010300_113,What's strange? Hm......What is that stuck in between its shell?
Dialog_Level17010300_114,Looks like a signal set up? But I've never seen this technology before... it's not human technology.
Dialog_Level17010300_115,Huh? Please don't make everything so mysterious just because you're a scientist.
Dialog_Level17010300_116,I'm serious! I always felt like we were being watched when we were doing those experiments......Are we the experimenters......or the experimented?
Dialog_Level17010300_117,I have goosebumps. Let's get outta here!
Dialog_Level17010300_118,Who are you? What are you doing here?
Dialog_Level17010300_119,Woaahh!! You scared me... I thought you were a ghost.
Dialog_Level17010300_120,"Um, you're not wrong from a certain point of view, she's a Ghoul. But who are you? What are you doing here?"
Dialog_Level17010300_121,"I'm Bobbie from Goodneighbor, a famous merchant. Have you never heard of me?"
Dialog_Level17010300_122,"Sorry, they're from a Vault. They've lived a very sheltered life."
Dialog_Level17010300_123,(Quietly whispers) I really don't want to know about Ghouls...
Dialog_Level17010300_124,Why would a merchant come here? Is there anything worth buying?
Dialog_Level17010300_125,Everything I want to buy is in the Mayor's safety deposit box in Diamond City.
Dialog_Level17010300_126,Oh... interesting. Guess you should head over to the Mayor's office.
Dialog_Level17010300_127,Oh! So that's why! Good luck.
Dialog_Level17010300_128,Let's pretend we didn't see each other. Sound good?
Dialog_Level17010300_129,Ok! No problem.
Dialog_Level17010300_130,What? What happened?
Dialog_Level17010300_131,Don't ask. You're better off not knowing.
Dialog_Level21010200_101,"This is Police Precinct 8, I have to say, the Ghouls here are not kidding around."
Dialog_Level21010200_102,I thought you were used to danger Miss Piper.
Dialog_Level21010200_103,"Well, I receive death threats everyday, but they aren't too bad."
Dialog_Level21010200_104,These Ghouls won't even say 'hi' to you when they come running for a hug.
Dialog_Level21010200_105,Right! So us girls need to learn how to protect ourselves. One way to do that is by blowing a Ghoul's head off.
Dialog_Level21010200_106,"You're brilliant, Miss Piper. But leave the dangerous stuff to us, just follow us at the back."
Dialog_Level21010200_107,Nick! You're still standing old man?
Dialog_Level21010200_108,"Piper, what a surprise. I know it may sound strange coming from me, but I'm very happy to see a living being."
Dialog_Level21010200_109,"Nick, how did you survive this long surrounded by Feral Ghouls?"
Dialog_Level21010200_110,"Oh, you know. They're not very smart, I disguised myself as a white Feral Ghoul, then they stopped troubling me."
Dialog_Level21010200_111,"But I can't pretend any longer, you came at a good time."
Dialog_Level21010200_112,I forgot to introduce you. These people come from a Vault. They need your help.
Dialog_Level21010200_113,Hello Vault Dwellers. This isn't the place to talk. Let's get out of here and let me hear your stories.
Dialog_Level21010100_101,(Gestures with index finger touching lips. Shush)
Dialog_Level21010100_102,(Nods)
Dialog_Level21010100_103,(Waves hand as a signal to follow)
Dialog_Level21010100_104,(Slips and hits a row of bookshelves)
Dialog_Level21010100_105,(Squints his eyes at the loud noise)
Dialog_Level21010100_106,(Shrinks his head and puts hands over ears)
Dialog_Level21010100_107,"(Makes a gesture, signaling danger ahead)"
Dialog_Level21010100_108,(Shakes his head confused)
Dialog_Level21010100_109,"(Changes gesture, signaling 'BIG' trouble ahead)"
Dialog_Level21010100_110,(Shakes head more confused)
Dialog_Level21010100_111,(Sighs and points ahead)
Dialog_Level21010100_112,Ah!
Dialog_Level21010100_113,Who? Who wants to be beaten up?
Dialog_Level21010100_114,"Oh my god, this is the library, have some decency!"
Dialog_Level21010100_115,"(Turns head, obvious annoyance in his eyes)"
Dialog_Level21010100_116,(Shrugs shoulders)
Dialog_Level21010100_117,"(Rolls eyes, gives a long, soft sigh)"
Dialog_Level21010400_101,"Careful, Raiders ahead!"
Dialog_Level21010400_102,......(signals 'come this way')
Dialog_Level21010400_103,Weird. This is the first time we came across a group of Raiders that didn't want to kill us.
Dialog_Level21010400_104,What are you doing?
Dialog_Level21010400_105,Egg.
Dialog_Level21010400_106,Did I hear him right? Did he say 'egg'?
Dialog_Level21010400_107,The Bonfire Clan stole this enormous egg. I want to boil it and see what it tastes like. Would you like to help?
Dialog_Level21010400_108,"Ok, firstly, stealing is not good, and secondly, where did you get an egg that big? I don't think boiling it is a good idea......"
Dialog_Level21010400_109,The Bonfire Clan will fight you if you don't help them.
Dialog_Level21010400_110,This discussion was shorter than expected......
Dialog_Level21010400_111,"Now, we should talk about what we should do with this egg......it's so big, is it......"
Dialog_Level21010400_112,Don't touch that egg!
Dialog_Level21010400_113,"Like I said, It's a family heirloom, so thank you for ensuring its safety."
Dialog_Level21010400_114,You......I......God! You can talk?!
Dialog_Level21010400_115,I must be dreaming......the legend from the West Coast is real......
Dialog_Level21010400_116,"Calm down, I mean you no harm. Like I said, I won't eat you."
Dialog_Level21010400_117,So it wasn't a metaphor......
Dialog_Level21010400_118,I don't get it. Why would a Deathclaw need our help? All of the Raider parties added together would pose no threat to you.
Dialog_Level21010400_119,"As you just saw, my child was taken hostage by the Raiders, I could not do this myself. If those Raiders saw me......they'd destroy my egg without a second thought."
Dialog_Level21010400_120,"So I needed some more 'delicate' helpers. Also, watching human's adventures is a......very interesting experience."
Dialog_Level21010400_121,I have a distant relative that used to hide his identity so that he could travel with humans. Maybe he had an influence on me.
Dialog_Level21010400_122,"Oh sweet irony. The Raiders we met along the way were either brutal or barbaric, but one thing that never changed was their stupidity."
Dialog_Level21010400_123,"And the only intelligent life that appeared on this whole quest was what we believed to be a monster. My friend, I have learned a lot today."
Dialog_Level21010400_124,"Likewise. So long, my friends, maybe one day our fates will cross paths again."
Dialog_Level21010400_125,So...so long!
Dialog_Level23010400_101,Vault Tech Headquarters... I heard they participated in the design of all the Vaults. I don't understand why people were so weird 200 years ago.
Dialog_Level23010400_102,"We should be grateful that we live in a ""normal"" Vault and that the current Overseer is smart, outstanding, and friendly."
Dialog_Level23010400_103,Isn't that a bit too much?
Dialog_Level23010400_104,I just want to praise them. They have the confidence to continue making the Vault better.
Dialog_Level23010400_105,Who are you? What are you doing here?
Dialog_Level23010400_106,Hey! Hey! Don't shoot! We're from a Vault. We came here looking for supplies. Who are you?
Dialog_Level23010400_107,Vault? Which Vault? Where?
Dialog_Level23010400_108,You seem to be a capable fighter. Do you want to join our Vault? We're located in the hills northwest of Concord.
Dialog_Level23010400_109,Really? I will take a look.
Dialog_Level23010400_110,Huh... she just left?
Dialog_Level22010100_101,"This is Vault 114, what we're looking for should be here."
Dialog_Level22010100_102,Then what are we waiting for? Let's get started.
Dialog_Level22010100_103,Who's there!
Dialog_Level22010100_104,"Put down your weapons, I mean you no harm."
Dialog_Level22010100_105,You're a Ghoul!
Dialog_Level22010100_106,"Hey! Watch your mouth! This is Mayor Hancock from Goodneighbor, show some respect."
Dialog_Level22010100_107,"Oh......I've heard of you, but this is my first time seeing you, Mayor Hancock."
Dialog_Level22010100_108,"It's ok, misunderstandings are inevitable when I make a sudden appearance looking like this."
Dialog_Level22010100_109,"Let me introduce you to my loyal helper, Fahrenheit."
Dialog_Level22010100_110,Nice to meet you.
Dialog_Level22010100_111,"Fine, I'll let you go this time, just because the Mayor said so."
Dialog_Level22010100_112,"Haha, of course, the more friends the better."
Dialog_Level22010100_113,Quite right. And you are?
Dialog_Level22010100_114,"We come from a Vault. We needed some equipment, so we decided to try our luck here."
Dialog_Level22010100_115,"Ah, understood. This is a Vault too, but this Vault was raided by Triggermen, so I'm afraid you'll need a lot of luck."
Dialog_Level22010100_116,"So Mayor, what are you doing here?"
Dialog_Level22010100_117,We're looking for an old friend of mine named Adric. He used to live in Goodneighbor.
Dialog_Level22010100_118,But it looks like he left already. Someone said he mentioned Vault 114. I thought I might try my luck here......looks like there's nothing
Dialog_Level22010100_119,"Understood. It's quite dangerous here, you......"
Dialog_Level22010100_120,"Don't worry, nothing's too dangerous when Fahrenheit is here."
Dialog_Level22010100_121,Haha......
Dialog_Level22010100_122,"Right, please allow us to say our farewells, good luck to you all!"
Dialog_Level22010100_123,"Thank you! And good luck to you, too!"
Dialog_Level22010100_124,"We've looked all around, but nothing."
Dialog_Level22010100_125,That Ghoul Hancock......I wonder if he found his friend?
Dialog_Level22010100_126,Clearly not. We haven't seen a living being here...... unless his friend is a Ghoul too?
Dialog_Level22010100_127,"Who knows. Our mission has been completed, let's go back to the Vault."
Dialog_Level5010101_101,I heard there was trouble here recently? Isn't this where we killed that albino Deathclaw before?
Dialog_Level5010101_102,"Doesn't matter, I'd make it fall like a real 'Deathclaw if it showed itself."
Dialog_Level5010101_103,"Well, now I really wish there is another albino Deathclaw so I can see your performance."
Dialog_Level5010101_104,"Come on then, let's go find another Deathclaw. I bet 50 Caps on myself."
Dialog_Level5010101_105,"Well, there is no albino Deathclaw, but these monsters seem to be attracted to something......"
Dialog_Level5010101_106,"Wait, there's something here!"
Dialog_Level5010101_107,Huh......this is......
Dialog_Level5010101_108,Wow! Poor little fellow—It's a furry cat.
Dialog_Level5010101_109,How did it get here? It's probably what's been attracting the monsters.
Dialog_Level5010101_110,"Luckily it survived long enough for us to arrive......don't be scared, little guy. You're safe now."
Dialog_Level23010300_101,Is this Pickman Gallery we heard on the radio?
Dialog_Level23010300_102,"No wonder Raiders are interested in this place. Security is terrible, we got in just like that!"
Dialog_Level23010300_103,So you're not with those Raiders?
Dialog_Level23010300_104,Who?!
Dialog_Level23010300_105,"I'm the owner of this place, Pickman."
Dialog_Level23010300_106,Oh! Sorry to barge in like that. We received a message from a group of Raiders. It said that they were going to raid this place.
Dialog_Level23010300_107,"Ah, is that so? Then I must thank you for your help."
Dialog_Level23010300_108,You said you thought we were with the Raiders. Does that mean they're here already?
Dialog_Level23010300_109,Just a bunch of thieves.
Dialog_Level23010300_110,"Oh, now that we're here, let us help."
Dialog_Level23010300_111,Ok.
Dialog_Level23010300_112,"Looks like the Raiders have been dealt with, our mission has been completed."
Dialog_Level23010300_113,Thank you again for your help.
Dialog_Level23010300_114,They made quite a mess of the place. You'll have to give it a good cleaning.
Dialog_Level23010300_115,"That's alright, I will turn them into pieces of art soon."
Dialog_Level23010300_116,Oh......uh......pieces of......art? How?
Dialog_Level23010300_117,With their blood and bones. You can come and see if you're interested.
Dialog_Level23010300_118,"Ah...haha...um...ok, we'll consider it. Bye, Mr. Pickman."
Dialog_Level23010300_119,Goodbye.
Dialog_Level22010400_101,"God, is there an end to these Triggermen?"
Dialog_Level22010400_102,Something doesn't seem right. These Triggermen are acting funny. What happened here?
Dialog_Level22010400_103,"They're definitely more agitated than regular Triggermen, and that makes them even more dangerous. Keep your eyes open, we can't be defeated here!"
Dialog_Level22010400_104,"There's a medical lab ahead, but......looks like something bad happened......"
Dialog_Level22010400_105,"Don't act rash, it feels odd, there might be danger."
Dialog_Level22010400_106,"I'll go alone, my Synthetic body can take anything. even if something does happen, you can just fix me."
Dialog_Level22010400_107,Nick......
Dialog_Level22010400_108,"Um......things just got complicated. Jacob March, the Overseer, you're trying to find may have been infected by the FEV virus."
Dialog_Level22010400_109,What?! What's the FEV virus?
Dialog_Level22010400_110,I found a Holotape that may answer some questions. We can discuss more afterward.
Dialog_Level22010400_111,"""The journey to Diamond City was not easy. No matter how hard I tried to lay low, trouble always seemed to find me."""
Dialog_Level22010400_112,"""When I finally made it to Diamond City, after asking around I found the best mechanic in the city. Her name is Vera."
Dialog_Level22010400_113,"""She is my only hope now, so I told her my secrets:"""
Dialog_Level22010400_114,"""Two weeks ago, I found some abnormalities with my Vault's Resource Purifier, some strange substance started to leak out of it, but this shouldn't have happened to my knowledge."""
Dialog_Level22010400_115,"""I went through relevant secret Documents, and found that this was a conspiracy that was planned 200 years ago—"""
Dialog_Level22010400_116,"""Our Resource Purifier was injected with a virus called FEV, when the pre-programmed time came, the Purifier would release the virus!"""
Dialog_Level22010400_117,"""And all of this, is to research the effect the FEV virus has on people living in a confined space for over 200 years. This is absolutely evil!"""
Dialog_Level22010400_118,"""That day, moments before the virus started leaking, I wasn't able to find anything to contain the virus. So I took the purifier, left the Vault and came to Boston for help. That's when I found Vera."""
Dialog_Level22010400_119,"""After having heard my story, Vera was very shocked and angry, she told me she might be able to separate the virus from the purifier, but she was needed a few tools."""
Dialog_Level22010400_120,"""Tomorrow, we will leave for Mass Bay Medical Center, they have better facilities and equipment."""
Dialog_Level22010400_121,"""Being in close contact with the Resource Purifier for the past few days has given me some side effects, but there is nothing to be afraid of anymore."""
Dialog_Level22010400_122,"""If everything goes well tomorrow, I can take the purifier back to the Vault and tell everyone that danger has been avoided."""
Dialog_Level22010400_123,We had no idea there was an experiment this vile happening in the Vault.
Dialog_Level22010400_124,But what exactly happened here? It doesn't look like everything went well.
Dialog_Level22010400_125,"Judging from the state of this place, a serious accident happened when they were separating the FEV container. There's a chance that Jacob and Vera have lost their sanity due to the virus, just like those Triggermen."
Dialog_Level22010400_126,"But I didn't find their bodies, or the Resource Purifier he was talking about. So Jacob probably, being insane, took the Purifier and left."
Dialog_Level22010400_127,What now?
Dialog_Level22010400_128,"I have a plan, but let us leave this dangerous place first."
Dialog_Level22010400_129,"No need for you to ask, I don't want to stay another second longer!"
Dialog_Level15010100_101,Our quest this time is to search the BADTFL pharmacy for a signal beacon.
Dialog_Level15010100_102,I have a feeling that someone wants us to be here... and...
Dialog_Level15010100_103,"Why so eerie...? Gather yourselves, we don't want to die here."
Dialog_Level15010100_104,You're here.
Dialog_Level15010100_105,Who are you!?
Dialog_Level15010100_106,"That's not important, I've been ordered to wait for you here."
Dialog_Level15010100_107,Ordered? By whom? And... did you place the beacon?
Dialog_Level15010100_108,No need to ask questions. Father wants to meet you. You will know soon enough.
Dialog_Level15010100_109,Father? Can it be...?
Dialog_Level15010100_110,These are the coordinates and travel pass. Come to the Institute. Don't keep Father waiting.
Dialog_Level15010100_111,The Institute... is this an invitation?
Dialog_Level15010100_112,Let's hurry back to the Vault and report this.
Dialog_Level15010400_101,Father's goal is to transform the Wasteland with Synth technology and create a brand new world. You humans are the largest benefactors.
Dialog_Level15010400_102,"In the grand scheme of things, the Synth problem is only a temporarily issue for the Institute."
Dialog_Level15010400_103,"This is the way of technology innovation. Problems continue to arise over time, but are naturally solved as technology develops."
Dialog_Level15010400_104,"We've been trying to resolve this, but there are people intentionally using the problem to make things worse."
Dialog_Level15010400_105,Oh? That means those opposed to the Institute all have their own intentions?
Dialog_Level15010400_106,"For the big picture, it doesn't matter how you interpret it. You humans believe too much into what you see and hear. When the new world is in front of you, you will understand."
Dialog_Level15010400_107,"Also, you should feel honored that Father has chosen you to witnesses the creation of the new world."
Dialog_Level15010400_108,How are we going to witness this?
Dialog_Level15010400_109,The best way to witness is to participate in the creation of the new world.
Dialog_Level15010400_110,"Think about it, if there weren't so many problems with Synths, would the Wasteland be better-off?"
Dialog_Level15010400_111,.....
Dialog_Level15010400_112,"Come, look at the evidence. If the rebel Synths are gone, lot's of issues will be solved and the world would be a better place."
Dialog_Level18010300_101,"Rumor says, someone saw Vera and the old Overseer come here."
Dialog_Level18010300_102,"After watching the Holotape found at the Mass Bay Medical Center, I really hope we can find our Overseer, but is this rumor reliable?"
Dialog_Level18010300_103,"Who knows, regardless let's look around."
Dialog_Level18010300_104,It's a shame we couldn't find any useful leads here. Rumors are rumors after all.
Dialog_Level18010300_105,There's nothing else we can do......we should go back to the Vault to report.
Dialog_Level18010300_106,Ok......
Dialog_Level18010300_107,"Huh, there's someone here......um, I think I know this oddly dressed guy."
Dialog_Level18010300_108,"I remember too, he's a guy from the Railroads."
Dialog_Level18010300_109,"What do you mean just a guy? You Vault guys! I'm Tom, a technical engineer at the Railroads."
Dialog_Level18010300_110,"Yes yes, we know. But what are you doing here alone? Aren't you scared of being found?"
Dialog_Level18010300_111,"Well, I don't go out very often, but I was lacking some raw materials. I remembered there are some in the area......"
Dialog_Level18010300_112,"Not in this room......maybe it's the other room, or that one......no, I've been to that room already, so that leaves this room."
Dialog_Level18010300_113,Which one?
Dialog_Level18010300_114,"That one! Never mind, you won't understand, I'll go look for my materials."
Dialog_Level18010300_115,What a weirdo......
Dialog_Level18010300_116,Yeah......
Dialog_Level18010500_101,Help!!
Dialog_Level18010500_102,We found the assistant!
Dialog_Level18010500_103,This is not the time to celebrate! Let's help!
Dialog_Level18010500_104,Help! S... save me!
Dialog_Level18010500_105,Hey! Lady! Aren't you glad to see us?
Dialog_Level18010500_106,"Don't be afraid! We're here, take cover behind us!"
Dialog_Level18010500_107,So? Your solo adventure must be exciting?
Dialog_Level18010500_108,.....
Dialog_Level18010500_109,It's great that we found you! Let's go back together. Everyone was worried sick after you left without word.
Dialog_Level18010500_110,.....
Dialog_Level18010500_111,"Come, let's go back. The Overseer is expecting you."
Dialog_Level18010100_101,"Ok, guys. Dez gave us very clear instructions, keep a low profile and don't look for trouble, understood?"
Dialog_Level18010100_102,"Hey, man, we've done countless jobs like this before. You, on the other hand, keep a low profile, ok?"
Dialog_Level18010100_103,"Hahaha, ok ok, I will."
Dialog_Level18010100_104,Careful. There's noise up ahead......
Dialog_Level18010100_105,It seems like there was a fight here......
Dialog_Level18010100_106,"It's the Synths from the Institute, they've found this place."
Dialog_Level18010100_107,"That's a good thing, right? We can just watch them kill each other."
Dialog_Level18010100_108,"No, if the Institute recycled these Synths, the Railroad's secrets won't be hidden much longer. Such a pain in the butt, now we have to kill them all at the same time."
Dialog_Level18010100_109,"Huh, I thought you only focused on saving Synths."
Dialog_Level18010100_110,"First, we're a secret organization, you should know what kind of person can hold secrets, haha."
Dialog_Level18010100_111,"The Institute wants our lives. We just want to be free, is there really nowhere for us to stay in this vast Wasteland?"
Dialog_Level18010100_112,"You have become Raiders and have harmed others in the Wasteland, of course we will see you as enemies."
Dialog_Level18010100_113,Bullcrap! You humans will just try to enslave us again. The Institute does this and so will the Railroad! We were forced into being Raiders because of you!
Dialog_Level18010100_114,"Wait, what do you mean......"
Dialog_Level18010100_115,Enough nonsense! Synths will never be slaves!
Dialog_Level18010100_116,"What a pity, the Wasteland is really harsh sometimes, maybe this is the best ending for those Synths."
Dialog_Level18010100_117,"I don't know why they see the Railroad as enemies, but it is what it is, this is the best ending for them."
Dialog_Level14010100_101,Is this the source of the signal? I think this place was abandoned a long time ago. It doesn't look like any living beings have been here.
Dialog_Level14010100_102,"No living beings......then who's sending the signals? Ah, I get it, the robots."
Dialog_Level14010100_103,"Interesting, what could have happened here to cause robots to send out signals this messed up? This mission just got complicated."
Dialog_Level14010100_104,"Maybe it's not so complicated, those robots from 200 years ago were never reliable."
Dialog_Level14010100_105,"But I can't see any robots, just a bunch of stupid Super Mutants......unless these mutants are Synths?"
Dialog_Level14010100_106,"What an imagination you have. There's no time to chat, they're about to attack us. Get ready to fight!"
Dialog_Level14010100_107,"Ah, hello humans. Are you here to put an end to my sad existence?"
Dialog_Level14010100_108,"Ooo, there's a Mr. Handy here. But what is it saying?"
Dialog_Level14010100_109,"Don't you understand? What meaning is there for a robot like me to exist? Humans, if you still have a slight respect for the rights of a robot, then please! Take! Me! Apart!"
Dialog_Level14010100_110,My god! What's wrong with this Mr. Handy?
Dialog_Level14010100_111,"Look, I found this experimental record. This Mr. Handy has had a personality module added, its name is Kevin. Obviously the experiment was a failure......"
Dialog_Level14010100_112,"Failure? The biggest failure is you humans not getting rid of an unsuccessful specimen like me, it's been 73683 days since I was produced and every day has been torture!"
Dialog_Level14010100_113,"......but looking at the experimental records, the scientist took away its personality module when he left. Maybe these modules are scattered all over the Commonwealth."
Dialog_Level14010100_114,"Kevin, can you locate the other personality modules? These modules might help you."
Dialog_Level14010100_115,"I could, but what would that accomplish? It would just mean torture in different ways."
Dialog_Level14010100_116,Just disassemble me! Quickly quickly! I can't wait any longer! Please......
Dialog_Level14010100_117,"Shut up, Kevin!"
Dialog_Level14010300_101,Um......Are you sure the raiders that robbed you are here?
Dialog_Level14010300_102,"100% sure, I followed them here!"
Dialog_Level14010300_103,But why aren't there any guards? It doesn't look like a raider camp.
Dialog_Level14010300_104,"Shh, listen carefully, can you hear that?"
Dialog_Level14010300_105,(Strange laughter and crying sounds come from a distance)Hahahaha......ah...waaahhh......
Dialog_Level14010300_106,"Let's......Let's leave, there are ghosts here."
Dialog_Level14010300_107,D......Don't panic...... there are no......ghosts in this world......right?
Dialog_Level14010300_108,"Shh......Shh, be careful......It's coming......we're doomed......"
Dialog_Level14010300_109,"Calm down, what did you see?"
Dialog_Level14010300_110,He must have seen a ghost.
Dialog_Level14010300_111,Ha...hahaha......I know you......the mushroom you planted......mushroom......
Dialog_Level14010300_112,Mushroom? What's he talking about?
Dialog_Level14010300_113,"Mushrooms......we ate it......ahahahahahaha......ah, it's coming! It's coming! Don't come near me! Go away! Go away!"
Dialog_Level14010300_114,Looks like this guy ate poisonous mushrooms that made him hallucinate. Who planted these mushrooms though? Do you know? Farmer?
Dialog_Level14010300_115,"This is impossible, I followed the graphs in 'The Wasteland Survival Guide'......Look, I still have this magazine......"
Dialog_Level14010300_116,"What? Let me see......ah, I get it now, look, there's a note at the side: 'These mushrooms will cause severe hallucination or even death if not cooked or planted correctly.'"
Dialog_Level14010300_117,"I think you should thank these raiders on some level. If they didn't eat your mushrooms, you'd be the crazy one."
Dialog_Level14010300_118,But how will I get through winter?
Dialog_Level14010300_119,"(Goes through the magazine) Plant some potatoes, 'The Wasteland Survival Guide' says potatoes have a very short growth time. You should have enough to make it through winter."
Dialog_Level14010300_120,"Alright, thank you. Take this magazine as a gift! This is the first issue, not very easy to find!"
Dialog_Level14010300_121,Really? Thank you so much!
Dialog_Level9010100_101,Why did you bring me here? To end me? Please end me!
Dialog_Level9010100_102,"Kevin, we're doing this for your own good. Maybe you'll feel better with a new personality module."
Dialog_Level9010100_103,"That's right, Kevin, we see you as our friend."
Dialog_Level9010100_104,"Really? If you really respected me, then you'd discard me......I......(starts sobbing) why couldn't you just take me apart......(wails)"
Dialog_Level9010100_105,Ahhhh......please hurry with the new personality module! This dude is making me depressed!
Dialog_Level9010100_106,"(Beep, beep) Beep......Beep......Why am I beeping......beep......make it stop......beep......make......beep..."
Dialog_Level9010100_107,"The module must be around here, let's get to it."
Dialog_Level9010100_108,"Ah, I can't concentrate with all this beeping."
Dialog_Level9010100_109,Beep...beep...
Dialog_Level9010100_110,Shut up! Kevin!
Dialog_Level9010100_111,"Found it, my god, put it on now!"
Dialog_Level9010100_112,Personality module implantation completed......bzzzzz......
Dialog_Level9010100_113,"Hey, babe. Did you miss me? Maybe I can prepare dinner for you, then we can change into something more comfortable...and...you know..."
Dialog_Level9010100_114,So......what do you think about the new Kevin?
Dialog_Level9010100_115,Absolutely not ok! We have to change it!
Dialog_Level9010100_116,What's the matter sweetie? Don't you like my voice?
Dialog_Level9010100_117,"......bzzzzzz......(changes to a deep sexy voice) My personality module comes with 260 different voices, I'm sure there's one of your liking, babe......"
Dialog_Level9010100_118,Shut up! Kevin!
Dialog_Level9010100_119,"Hm, there's a moving Mr. Handy, he's your......"
Dialog_Level9010100_120,Oh! You look very strong! You'll put an end to me right? Come! Put an end to me!
Dialog_Level9010100_121,Kevin! Stop!
Dialog_Level9010100_122,......This Mr. Handy has lost it. What technology is this?
Dialog_Level9010100_123,"Uhh......this is awkward, we don't know how to explain this, but we're looking for his personality module."
Dialog_Level9010100_124,Personality module? The Brotherhood has never come across technology such as that. But it seems like......it's not really doing anything.
Dialog_Level9010100_125,"Hahaha......So you're a friend of the Brotherhood, we know Paladin Danse, he helps us out in our Vault."
Dialog_Level9010100_126,"Oh, so you're the dwellers from the Vault, nice to meet you. But if you take this Mr. Handy with you......"
Dialog_Level9010100_127,Yes yes! Don't take me! Please end this tragic life of mine!
Dialog_Level9010100_128,Shut up! Kevin!
Dialog_Level9010100_129,"Mmhh......you see, Mr. Handy here, is......um......out of it. Maybe we can solve the problem if we find its module."
Dialog_Level9010100_130,"You can take a look in the deeper parts. I don't have data on this type of technology, so I'm afraid I can't help you."
Dialog_Level9010100_131,"That's quite alright, we will go look for it ourselves."
Dialog_Level9010100_132,"I'm going to leave, good luck to you all."
Dialog_Level9010100_133,Okay. Say hello to Danse for us.
Dialog_Level10010200_101,"According to our spy's intel, this is the Raiders' lair."
Dialog_Level10010200_102,"I don't really understand the mission, why would those thieves go all this way just to steal a guitar? Why did we take a mission this boring?"
Dialog_Level10010200_103,"Please, can you really say no to a crying lady?"
Dialog_Level10010200_104,"(Sighs) You're right, I......I just think we have more important things to do."
Dialog_Level10010200_105,Have you defeated my useless followers? Brilliant! You seem smart. Maybe we can talk business.
Dialog_Level10010200_106,"(In a low voice) Haven't seen a Raider this cliche in a long time. I miss the old days. Just watch, he's going to tell us all about that guitar."
Dialog_Level10010200_107,Do you know why I went through all this trouble for a guitar?
Dialog_Level10010200_108,(Gives a slight smile)
Dialog_Level10010200_109,"11 years ago, this guitar belonged to the most famous guitarist in Boston: Adric Placton. It's said that he has an untold secret hidden in this guitar."
Dialog_Level10010200_110,Are you interested in unveiling this secret and making a fortune?
Dialog_Level10010200_111,"Sounds good, but I don't negotiate with thieves."
Dialog_Level10010200_112,"Pity, I thought you were smart."
Dialog_Level10010200_113,"Ahem......Don't even think about taking this guitar, not even when I'm dead! (Breaks the guitar)"
Dialog_Level10010200_114,Ah!
Dialog_Level10010200_115,This is my fault. Why wouldn't I think that this old Raider would do such a thing?
Dialog_Level10010200_116,"Hey, look at the broken box of this guitar, there is a hologram cassette stuck on it!"
Dialog_Level10010200_117,Is this the so-called secret? I think we should solve this mystery so we can give our client an acceptable answer.
Dialog_Level10010200_118,I agree. Let's listen to the Holotape.
Dialog_Level10010200_119,"""Lucy, if you're listening to this Holotape, it means you've probably broken my guitar. Don't worry, it's not a treasure or anything."""
Dialog_Level10010200_120,"""I have left you something of great importance to me, you should go to Parsons Cheese Factory. The place where we first met."""
Dialog_Level10010200_121,"""I'm not saying that you're clumsy because you broke this guitar, everything breaks eventually, doesn't it?"""
Dialog_Level10010200_122,"""Your Adric Placton."""
Dialog_Level10010200_123,"Okay, let's bring this message back to Lucy."
Dialog_Level9010300_101,This is the other location marked on the Ex-Overseer's map!
Dialog_Level9010300_102,"No more talking, begin the search! I have a strong feeling..."
Dialog_Level9010300_103,Sigh... My hunch was correct... still nothing here.
Dialog_Level9010300_104,That's too bad... Report back to the Vault...
Dialog_Level9010300_105,"The higher the hope, the greater the disappointment..."
Dialog_Level10010300_101,"Ok, friends, let's recycle some lost technology."
Dialog_Level10010300_102,"Captain Kells have told me about your situation. Don't worry, I'm happy to help friends from the Vault."
Dialog_Level10010300_103,"Thank you, Miss Haylen."
Dialog_Level10010300_104,"(Quietly) Hey, my uh...ahem, my friend has a personal favor to ask."
Dialog_Level10010300_105,"(Quietly) There are often toys collected by the dwellers in the Vault, if you happen to come across teddy bears or other things, my......friend would appreciate it very much."
Dialog_Level10010300_106,"Uh......Ok, no problem!"
Dialog_Level10010300_107,"It's the Overseer's office ahead. If we're lucky, we might find a Resource Purifier here."
Dialog_Level10010300_108,But we've never really been lucky.
Dialog_Level10010300_109,"Yeah, I agree. We weren't able to recycle anything worthy on the way."
Dialog_Level10010300_110,"Hey, look at this guy's weapon...... look familiar?"
Dialog_Level10010300_111,This is......a disassembled Resource Purifier! What a waste!
Dialog_Level10010300_112,Looks like this thing can't be fixed anymore......But didn't Nick say broken things might be useful too?
Dialog_Level10010300_113,"I hope so......Haylen, thanks for your help."
Dialog_Level10010300_114,"Hahaha, I'm happy to be of assistance. This counts as a successful mission, let's go..."
Dialog_Level10010300_115,Watch out! There's a Triggerman!
Dialog_Level10010300_116,"Don't panic, my friend! Strictly speaking, I'm a former Triggerman, but now I'm a free mercenary."
Dialog_Level10010300_117,"Hm, I can't tell the difference."
Dialog_Level10010300_118,"There's a huge difference, at least you don't have to see me as a dangerous enemy."
Dialog_Level10010300_119,Really. Then tell us why you're here?
Dialog_Level10010300_120,"Ahem, well......I wanted to try my luck here and see if I could find some Jet. You know, Triggermen like this kind of stuff."
Dialog_Level10010300_121,Jet? What's that?
Dialog_Level10010300_122,"Wow! My friend, where did you come from?"
Dialog_Level10010300_123,You don't even know what Jet is? That is not acceptable.
Dialog_Level10010300_124,"Hey......pretty lady, that makes me very happy. If I manage to find Jet, it's all mine. Goodbye."
Dialog_Level10010300_125,What a sad addict......
Dialog_Level10010300_126,I still don't get it......
Dialog_Level11010100_102,"I really can't stand to see you like this, do you want me to......help you get clean?"
Dialog_Level11010100_104,"Sorry I made you jealous, babe......you know, my personality module makes it hard to control myself, my fusion fuel is burning inside, I have to let it out, ah......"
Dialog_Level11010100_105,I can't take it anymore......
Dialog_Level11010100_106,(Beep beep) Babe......beep......do you like my beeping sound......beep......I can beep all night long for you......beep......
Dialog_Level11010100_107,"Found it, a new personality module, put it in now! I can't stand another second of this!"
Dialog_Level11010100_108,Personality module implantation completed......bzzzzz......
Dialog_Level11010100_109,What are you looking at?
Dialog_Level11010100_110,Kevin......are you alright?
Dialog_Level11010100_111,"Am I alright? Stupid humans, you have the decency to ask such a question? To punish your stupidity, you have to repair me!"
Dialog_Level11010100_112,Hey! Kevin's personality got worse!
Dialog_Level11010100_113,"How dare you say I have a bad personality? Lowlife, do you know who you're talking to?! Get your attitude right, worm!"
Dialog_Level11010100_114,Shut up! Kevin!
Dialog_Level13010100_101,You're late! I didn't pay you to play around!
Dialog_Level13010100_102,(Yawns) Can you tell me what exactly are we doing here? This should be my day off......
Dialog_Level13010100_103,"(Waves her treasure map) We are here for the fortune, understood?"
Dialog_Level13010100_104,That hobo from before promised me that this map will lead to enough treasure to make as rich as 10 kings! Aren't you going to thank me for taking you on this trip with me?
Dialog_Level13010100_105,(Mutters) You'd believe a hobo......
Dialog_Level13010100_106,What?
Dialog_Level13010100_107,What?
Dialog_Level13010100_108,"There's no end to these creatures, I'm not getting paid enough!"
Dialog_Level13010100_109,What? Aren't you experienced enough in battle? Can't even take down these weaklings?
Dialog_Level13010100_110,"It just that......Ahhh, my back hurts!"
Dialog_Level13010100_111,"You......fine, once we find the treasure, I can give you an extra 5% ."
Dialog_Level13010100_112,"(Holds forehead) Focus on the mission, ok? We haven't even seen a glimpse of the treasure yet!"
Dialog_Level13010100_113,"This is it. Guards, help me look around for the treasure!"
Dialog_Level13010100_114,"Hmm......Look at this safety box......I should have figured, this magazine is the so called treasure."
Dialog_Level13010100_115,You kidding? Let me see......'Wasteland Survival Guide: Commonwealth coupon collection?' What is this?
Dialog_Level13010100_116,"Theoretically, these coupons will save you a lot of money."
Dialog_Level13010100_117,But they are expired! They're not even worth one cap!
Dialog_Level13010100_118,"Ahem......So, now that you don't have any money to pay us, why don't you give us this magazine as compensation?"
Dialog_Level13010100_119,(Sneering) Alright alright......I can't have my muscle spreading rumors that I don't pay my dues. The magazine is yours!
Dialog_Level13010100_120,Who are you! How dare you barge into The Forged's territory!
Dialog_Level13010100_121,Ah......raiders!
Dialog_Level13010100_122,"Don't be scared, we have......"
Dialog_Level13010100_123,Don't hurt us! We're just......just here......looking for something......
Dialog_Level13010100_124,Looking for something? Haha! Everything in the Forged's territory belongs to the Forged!
Dialog_Level13010100_125,No no......That's my treasure......
Dialog_Level13010100_126,Treasure? Hahaha......It's the Forged's tre......wait! What's that in your hand?
Dialog_Level13010100_127,It's my treasure map......
Dialog_Level13010100_128,"......You mean, you were looking for the treasures using that map?"
Dialog_Level13010100_129,Ye......yes......
Dialog_Level13010100_130,"Ha! So......lame. Go then, go look for your nonexistent treasure."
Dialog_Level13010100_131,Huh?
Dialog_Level13010100_132,Huh?
Dialog_Level13010100_133,He left......those were the strangest raiders I've ever come across.
Dialog_Level13010100_134,Hm. Maybe......
Dialog_Level13010100_135,This is great! The raiders have left. Let's go get the treasure and then ske-daddle!
Dialog_Level12010100_101,"See, it's only this big, need I say more? Finish the work then go home."
Dialog_Level12010100_102,"Ok, we can go......"
Dialog_Level12010100_103,Wait! What is that?
Dialog_Level12010100_104,It's a watch. It has a Vault logo on it with the Overseer's name! There's also a......signal transmitter stuck to it!
Dialog_Level12010100_105,"Let me see, let me see!"
Dialog_Level12010100_106,Is this the source of the weak signal we detected in the radio station?
Dialog_Level12010100_107,I feel like something strange is afoot.
Dialog_Level12010100_108,"What are we waiting for, let's take it back to the Vault."
Dialog_Level12010200_101,"Before we start this mission, I want to know what kind of person this wandering guitarist is."
Dialog_Level12010200_102,"I did some digging and found it's like what the Raider said. 10 years ago, Adric Placton was one of the most famous bar performers."
Dialog_Level12010200_103,"His whole story is shrouded in mystery. One day, out of the blue, he appeared and suddenly started singing in a bar in Diamond City, then 5 years later he left the city, never to be seen again."
Dialog_Level12010200_104,"Let me guess, our client Miss Lucy is the only friend Placton has in the city?"
Dialog_Level12010200_105,"That's right, so what we're looking for might be the only legacy Placton left behind in Diamond City."
Dialog_Level12010200_106,Interesting.
Dialog_Level12010200_107,"Look at this place, covered with trash and stinking carcasses, rats wouldn't even want to make their nests here. If I was Adric, I'd definitely hide my secrets here."
Dialog_Level12010200_108,"Perfect Wasteland logic, let's take a look."
Dialog_Level12010200_109,"Found it! My god, it's another Holotape......"
Dialog_Level12010200_110,"Who even listens to Holotapes nowadays? Everyone is shoot first, ask questions later or scrounging to survive out of the garbage."
Dialog_Level12010200_111,"It's nice to be nostalgic once in a while, Let's check out what secret he has for us now."
Dialog_Level12010200_112,"""Lucy, I hid this box of Holotapes in the place where we first met. As expected, it's still a trash heap, just like my life when we first met eyes."""
Dialog_Level12010200_113,"""I was a traveling busker at the time, moving through the Wasteland, begging for money by playing guitar. My life was down in the dumps, until I met you."""
Dialog_Level12010200_114,"""It's you who pulled me out of the trash, took me to Diamond City, and recommended me to take up performing in bars."""
Dialog_Level12010200_115,"""Years of wandering not knowing where my next meal would come from, made me socially awkward. It was you who healed my broken heart, and made me realize performing was my dream."""
Dialog_Level12010200_116,"""I have hidden my last secret near the Cannery. You know, the one you used to take me to whenever I felt down."""
Dialog_Level12010200_117,"""It was the happiest time of my life. Yours, Adric Placton."""
Dialog_Level12010200_118,"Yes, we're one step closer to the treasure."
Dialog_Level12010300_101,I heard the guy that sent this SOS signal was trying to train a Mirelurk so he can ride it?
Dialog_Level12010300_102,That's right.
Dialog_Level12010300_103,Did his head get hit by one too many Mirelurk claws?
Dialog_Level12010300_104,"It's actually a 'she, ' the signal the station received had a woman's voice."
Dialog_Level12010300_105,"Interesting, I'm guessing this woman pretty brave......but a little thick in the head."
Dialog_Level12010300_106,"Who knows, we should try and interview her after we rescue her."
Dialog_Level12010300_107,Woah! Thank you. These Mirelurks are very stubborn. My plan to train them with Radroach meat has failed. Wouldn't it be cool if we could train them to let us ride them?
Dialog_Level12010300_108,"Ah, forgot to introduce myself, my name is Moira Brown, from the The Capital."
Dialog_Level12010300_109,Moira......Moira Brown the author of 'Wasteland Survival Guide?' Oh my God! I'm your biggest fan!
Dialog_Level12010300_110,"Very glad to meet you. Looks like I've made a name for myself in the Commonwealth, haha."
Dialog_Level12010300_111,Could you sign my copy of the 'Wasteland Survival Guide?'
Dialog_Level12010300_112,Of course! And you did me a great service! I'll definitely be writing about your heroic acts in my new book! It'll be my best work yet!
Dialog_Level12010300_113,(Jumping with excitement) This is the best day of my life!
Dialog_Level12010500_101,We're here.
Dialog_Level12010500_102,"This looks dangerous, are we really going to collect data on this place?"
Dialog_Level12010500_103,"To be precise, I will be collecting data on you."
Dialog_Level12010500_104,What?
Dialog_Level12010500_105,"Oh, I failed to mention, The Institute wants to collect data on dwellers when they are under extreme circumstances. Hahaha."
Dialog_Level12010500_106,Clark! You jerk!
Dialog_Level12010500_107,It's Kellogg!
Dialog_Level12010500_108,Whoo......That was close!
Dialog_Level12010500_109,Hey! Did I say you could rest?!
Dialog_Level12010500_110,Are......Is there not enough data?
Dialog_Level12010500_111,I said under 'extreme circumstances.' What happened just now is far from extreme.
Dialog_Level12010500_112,You......you must be enjoying this......
Dialog_Level12010500_113,What do you think?
Dialog_Level12010500_114,Have you got it now?
Dialog_Level12010500_115,I didn't say that.
Dialog_Level12010500_116,My god......how does the Institute......define extreme?
Dialog_Level12010500_117,Hmm......
Dialog_Level12010500_118,What's wrong?
Dialog_Level12010500_119,"Looks like we've been toyed with, there's no one here taking the experimental data."
Dialog_Level12010500_120,What? So we went through all of this for nothing?
Dialog_Level12010500_121,"Do you really know what is meaningless? All of this is meaningless, or does all of this mean something?"
Dialog_Level12010500_122,"The Wasteland is a playground for the Institute, everything is an experiment, maybe I'm a part of their experiment too."
Dialog_Level12010500_123,"Didn't think you were a nihilist, Kellogg."
Dialog_Level12010500_124,"......Never mind. Regardless of everything else, you held you promises, the FEV virus recognition signal data is yours."
Dialog_Level12010500_125,"Use this data wisely, little mice."
Dialog_Level12010500_126,Aren't you a little mouse yourself?
Dialog_Level12010500_127,I never said I wasn't one.
Dialog_Level12010500_128,"Who are you? Why are you here? It's very dangerous, please leave!"
Dialog_Level12010500_129,"Uh......Thanks for the heads up, but we came here for a reason. As for you, who are you?"
Dialog_Level12010500_130,Me? I'm Jack Cabot.
Dialog_Level12010500_131,"Ok, Jack, you said it yourself. It's dangerous, so you must be careful since you're alone."
Dialog_Level12010500_132,"Don't worry, I know this place very well. Plus, I'm the one that sent the most dangerous person here."
Dialog_Level12010500_133,Hm? What does that mean?
Dialog_Level12010500_134,"Don't ask too many questions, finish what you came here for and leave. Bye."
Dialog_Level12010500_135,"Weird, but he seems like a good person."
Dialog_Level12010500_136,Jack!!!
Dialog_Level12010500_137,Shoot! What happened? Is there a riot at the asylum?
Dialog_Level12010500_138,Jack! Come here!! Come to Daddy!! Hahahahaha!!
Dialog_Level12010500_139,My god! This maniac has lost it!
Dialog_Level12010500_140,"Don't be a fool, is there a maniac that hasn't lost it?"
Dialog_Level12010500_141,Come here! Son! Come to Daddy! Come to Daddy!
Dialog_Level12010500_142,You! You're here because of Jack right? You look at me like you're looking at a monkey. Hahaha!
Dialog_Level12010500_143,Good! Good! What a good boy! Hahaha!
Dialog_Level12010500_144,"Keep on watching then, do whatever you like!"
Dialog_Level12010500_145,Let's......Let's get out of this room......
Dialog_Level12010500_146,What a creep......
Dialog_Level12010500_147,"So Jack is his son? To have a dad like him, must be......"
Dialog_Level12010500_148,Just dreadful.
Dialog_Level25010100_101,"Hey, does anyone know why we're here?"
Dialog_Level25010100_102,"No, but aren't we here for the Overseer?"
Dialog_Level25010100_103,Luckily not this time.
Dialog_Level25010100_104,"Wow, shouldn't we be happy that we're not looking for the Overseer? Then what are we doing now?"
Dialog_Level25010100_105,"We need to find the origin of that signal we caught in the radio station, it was trying to send some kind of message."
Dialog_Level25010100_106,......I don't like finding things like this.
Dialog_Level25010100_107,"We've checked here already, there's nothing special."
Dialog_Level25010100_108,"See? I was just saying, I hate doing things like this."
Dialog_Level25010100_109,Is there anything you hate more than this?
Dialog_Level25010100_110,Of course!
Dialog_Level25010100_111,What is it?
Dialog_Level25010100_112,Not being able to find them.
Dialog_Level25010300_101,"Kevin, Kevin?"
Dialog_Level25010300_102,Take that swing! Rubbish appliances produced by the RobCo company! General Atomics International is the best manufacturer of intelligent robots!
Dialog_Level25010300_103,"Kevin, what are you talking about?"
Dialog_Level25010300_104,"Don't you have ears? Can't you see? This useless robot was mocking my calculating abilities! You're not good enough, you hear that? Piece of junk!"
Dialog_Level25010300_105,(Lets out a painful and sad moan)
Dialog_Level25010300_106,I'm starting to doubt my decision of not disassembling Kevin when we first met him.
Dialog_Level25010300_107,(Beep beep) Beep......That's right lowlife......taste my......beep......you......beep......beep......I will......beep......
Dialog_Level25010300_108,"This is the last time, I swear if it still doesn't work this time, I will shoot him!"
Dialog_Level25010300_109,"Found it, the last personality module!"
Dialog_Level25010300_110,"Personality module implantation completed......bzzzzz......Error, error, error......"
Dialog_Level25010300_111,Kevin?
Dialog_Level25010300_112,"Error, error......system rebooting......"
Dialog_Level25010300_113,"Gosh darn it, don't give up now......Kevin? Kevin?"
Dialog_Level25010300_114,"I've already told you, all of this is meaningless. You......bzzzzz......you worms, just don't know when to quit, I......"
Dialog_Level25010300_115,"Bzzzzz......I want to lie down next to the furnace with you, what do you think? Babe?"
Dialog_Level25010300_116,What do you think?
Dialog_Level25010300_117,I'm out of solutions......just let it be......
Dialog_Level25010300_118,Beep......Babe!
Dialog_Level25010300_119,Shut up! Kevin!
Dialog_Level25010500_101,"I can't believe it, we came all this way just because of some Holotapes from a broken guitar."
Dialog_Level25010500_102,I have a feeling this guitarist's secret is probably a Holotape.
Dialog_Level25010500_103,"This is not important anymore, there's a start and end to everything. I really want to know the ending to this story."
Dialog_Level25010500_104,"This a peaceful place, Placton said Lucy often took him here to relax."
Dialog_Level25010500_105,"Yeah, I might consider moving here for retirement."
Dialog_Level25010500_106,"Haha, that's a good joke, the Wasteland won't give us a chance to retire."
Dialog_Level25010500_107,I smell secrets.
Dialog_Level25010500_108,Really? You learned a few tricks from Dogmeat.
Dialog_Level25010500_109,"See, I found it. This should be Placton's last secret — another Holotape."
Dialog_Level25010500_110,"Let's listen to it, I can't wait to know what happened next."
Dialog_Level25010500_111,"""Lucy, I still clearly remember the days we spent here. We barely talked, you knew I didn't talk much."""
Dialog_Level25010500_112,"""You quietly did your work and I quietly wrote my song. It is here that I wrote 'Lucy', named after you, your favorite song."""
Dialog_Level25010500_113,"""Maybe you really want to know why I left without saying goodbye, leaving you with only an old guitar. I'm very sorry that I couldn't say goodbye to you, just like how I never got to tell you about my feelings."""
Dialog_Level25010500_114,"""It was when you wanted to move to Goodneighbor, I decided to leave the Commonwealth and continue my life as a wanderer."""
Dialog_Level25010500_115,"""I had always been a coward before meeting you, I have always run away from my problems. Maybe you still think that I'm a coward after I ran away from you."""
Dialog_Level25010500_116,"""But I am not afraid anymore, I will walk across every corner of the Wasteland, and let everyone hear the song that belongs to you, 'Lucy.'"""
Dialog_Level25010500_117,"""This is my secret: Though I am wandering somewhere far away, my heart will forever belong to you."""
Dialog_Level25010500_118,"""Yours Adric Placton."""
Dialog_Level25010500_119,Aww......that's so moving......this is a real treasure!
Dialog_Level25010500_120,Aww......that was beautiful......but I still hoped there were actual treasures.
Dialog_Level26010200_101,"These people are probably what is left of the thieves that stole the guitar, haven't they given up already?"
Dialog_Level26010200_102,"We need to hurry up, I will not let them off easy if they hurt Miss Lucy."
Dialog_Level26010200_103,When did you start caring about someone you just met?
Dialog_Level26010200_104,I just......I hope this story has a happy ending.
Dialog_Level26010200_105,You came! I thought you didn't care about the life of a random woman.
Dialog_Level26010200_106,"Now that you're here, hand over Placton's treasure! Then I'll let her go."
Dialog_Level26010200_107,What a rude guy......
Dialog_Level26010200_108,(Quietly) Leave it to me.
Dialog_Level26010200_109,What do you think Placton left behind?
Dialog_Level26010200_110,"Duh, he must have left behind a huge fortune given how famous he was before. Maybe the Caps he left behind can buy half of Goodneighbor."
Dialog_Level26010200_111,(Exaggerated laugh) Hahahahahaha!
Dialog_Level26010200_112,What are you laughing about!
Dialog_Level26010200_113,"I hate to be the one to tell you, Placton only left behind some Holotapes, they're of no use to you."
Dialog_Level26010200_114,"No, not possible! You're lying!"
Dialog_Level26010200_115,"I've only got these Holotapes on me, come and get it if you want."
Dialog_Level26010200_116,Ahhhhhhh!
Dialog_Level26010200_117,"Thank you for saving me, I never thought this guitar would cause so much trouble."
Dialog_Level26010200_118,"You're welcome, Miss Lucy. I have a good news and a bad news."
Dialog_Level26010200_119,"Bad news is, Placton's guitar was shattered by the thieves. But good news is, we found the Holotapes he left for you."
Dialog_Level26010200_120,I......Let me listen to what he left for me.
Dialog_Level26010200_121,"(After listening to the Holotape, she closed her eyes and smiled warmly)"
Dialog_Level26010200_122,(Quietly) What an idiot!
Dialog_Level26010200_123,"Thank you again, this is very meaningful to me. I think I will be leaving the Commonwealth very soon, hopefully I can find this wandering guitarist out on the Wasteland."
Dialog_Level26010200_124,"Don't worry, Miss Lucy. As long as you follow the music, I believe you can find him!"
Dialog_Level24010100_101,"Ok, who's sending the distress signal? There's only a group of Raiders living here."
Dialog_Level24010100_102,"Shh, I think I hear something?"
Dialog_Level24010100_103,Sounds like a drunk brahmin banging its head on the wall.
Dialog_Level24010100_104,"That...that's very specific, but I don't think brahmin can make such a ruckus."
Dialog_Level24010100_105,"If I guessed right, then you'll have to pay for dinner!"
Dialog_Level24010100_106,Help! Help!
Dialog_Level24010100_107,"Does this mean that you're the ones sending out the distress call? Weird, you look like you have enough provisions and you can obviously protect yourselves."
Dialog_Level24010100_108,"And you also look like you've been Wasteland Raiders for a very long time. How could you run away like such pussies, don't you have a bit of self respect?"
Dialog_Level24010100_109,"No, you don't understand, the milk freak......Never mind! There's no time! Let's get to it! Otherwise we won't be so polite!"
Dialog_Level24010100_110,I wonder what's scaring these Raiders.
Dialog_Level24010100_111,What I know for sure is it definitely isn't a two-headed cow.
Dialog_Level24010100_112,"Darn, you're right."
Dialog_Level24010100_113,Strong! Strong! Wants! Milk!
Dialog_Level24010100_114,Uh......that doesn't sound good.
Dialog_Level24010100_115,"Little humans come here? Those little humans won't help Strong find milk, Strong angry, Strong hit them! New little humans help Strong find milk?"
Dialog_Level24010100_116,Milk?
Dialog_Level24010100_117,"Yes, good man Rex told me, Milk of Human Kindness can make Strong stronger, so Strong find milk! Good human milk!"
Dialog_Level24010100_118,"(Whispers) I'm guessing he means 'Milk of Human Kindness' from 'Macbeth', how are we supposed to find that?"
Dialog_Level24010100_119,What did little human say?!
Dialog_Level24010100_120,No......nothing! Little humans help you find......find milk! Yes! Help Strong find milk!
Dialog_Level24010100_121,Really? Little humans are good people!
Dialog_Level24010200_101,Strong don't understand.
Dialog_Level24010200_102,What's wrong Strong?
Dialog_Level24010200_103,"Mutants like to fight little humans, Strong understand. But why do humans like fighting humans?"
Dialog_Level24010200_104,"To answer this question my friend, we'd have to talk about a philosophic study on Post-Apocalyptic Existence Theory. And we don't have the time nor the environment to get into detail."
Dialog_Level24010200_105,"These are bad people that want to kill us, Strong will help us right?"
Dialog_Level24010200_106,"Uh, Strong don't know folisophy, but Strong know how to fight!"
Dialog_Level24010200_107,"Careful, that guy looks like the leader of these Raiders. He......he looks busy......"
Dialog_Level24010200_108,"Please my lady, I'll let you go right away, don't ask any more questions!"
Dialog_Level24010200_109,"Mr., why are you so agitated? I can see your blood pressure rising, do you need medical help? Is this living condition making you feel ill?"
Dialog_Level24010200_110,Somebody help me......
Dialog_Level24010200_111,(Clears throat) Excuse me?
Dialog_Level24010200_112,Please free me!
Dialog_Level24010200_113,"Thank you for your help! My name is Curie, Contagions Vulnerability Robotic Infirmary Engineer."
Dialog_Level24010200_114,"I came here to learn more about the Wasteland, but this experienced raider doesn't seem to want to answer my questions."
Dialog_Level24010200_115,"Uh, miss, I think the right way to put it is that this raider kidnapped you......"
Dialog_Level24010200_116,"Oh, I believe Mr. Raider had his reasons. Dear travelers, do you need any help from Curie?"
Dialog_Level24010200_117,"This big green friend, you look different from everyone else, I think I can learn a lot of things from you......"
Dialog_Level24010200_118,Woman weird......Woman know about good Milk of Human Kindness? Strong wants milk!
Dialog_Level24010200_119,"Milk? That's something very nutritious. But I'm curious, big green friend, your body structure looks different, you probably can't absorb milk nutrients."
Dialog_Level24010200_120,"If you don't mind, I can do a full body check for you....."
Dialog_Level24010200_121,Woman weird! Woman scary! Strong don't want check! Strong leave!
Dialog_Level24010200_122,Didn't think our big friend there would be scared of a body check.
Dialog_Level24010400_101,"Strong hear fighting, who fighting mutants?!"
Dialog_Level24010400_102,"Calm down Strong, we'll know soon enough."
Dialog_Level24010400_103,"But, Strong, won't your friend be confused when they see you with humans?"
Dialog_Level24010400_104,"Other mutants are weak, they don't understand Strong. Strong find milk, Strong prove Strong stronger than them!"
Dialog_Level24010400_105,"Good to see your on our side, Strong."
Dialog_Level24010400_106,"Small humans don't worry, little humans help Strong find milk, Strong like humans."
Dialog_Level24010400_107,"Wow, miss, did you defeat all of these mutants yourself?"
Dialog_Level24010400_108,"It's just a warm up before the fight in Arena, what are you doing here?"
Dialog_Level24010400_109,Woman strong! Did woman drink milk?
Dialog_Level24010400_110,What milk?
Dialog_Level24010400_111,"Milk of Human Kindness! Strong know it will make stronger, woman defeated all those mutants, she must have drank a lot of milk!"
Dialog_Level24010400_112,"Listen, big green guy. In my years in the Arena, I learned that being strong means to overcome yourself."
Dialog_Level24010400_113,"Your biggest enemy is yourself, if you can't understand this, then you'll never be strong."
Dialog_Level24010400_114,"So......I cannot be counted as strong. You found the wrong person, big guy."
Dialog_Level24010400_115,Hard! Strong not understand......Strong just want milk!
Dialog_Level24010400_116,(Quietly) Looks like our journey won't be ending soon.
Dialog_Level28010100_101,"Milk, so hard to find......"
Dialog_Level28010100_102,"Strong, maybe you should know, this 'milk' is actually......"
Dialog_Level28010100_103,"(Gave a look) Don't give up, Strong, we should find it soon enough!"
Dialog_Level28010100_104,Good humans......
Dialog_Level28010100_105,"Look, there are so many bad people, Strong likes hitting bad people, right?"
Dialog_Level28010100_106,"(Lazily) Great, another bunch of salesmen. What's with my luck today."
Dialog_Level28010100_107,What are you saying?
Dialog_Level28010100_108,"A strange guy came half an hour ago, he was advertising his 'ways of cool.'"
Dialog_Level28010100_109,"I told him many times that I was not interested, he said he'd be back. I assumed you were together."
Dialog_Level28010100_110,I find it harder and harder to understand you.
Dialog_Level28010100_111,"I think I explained it good enough, promotions are not welcome here."
Dialog_Level28010100_112,"Oh man, why did I waste so much time talking to a bunch of salesmen, I'm a Raider. I should be refusing sales in the Raider's way!"
Dialog_Level28010100_113,Uh......Looks like I'm late.
Dialog_Level28010100_114,Are you the salesman he was talking about?
Dialog_Level28010100_115,"I just wanted him to change for the better and be a cool Atom cat, a lot of Raiders have given up their ways of living after learning about the Atom Cats."
Dialog_Level28010100_116,"Metal man look amazing, did metal man drink Strong milk?"
Dialog_Level28010100_117,"Strong? Big guy, you look strong already, but you're not cool enough."
Dialog_Level28010100_118,"You should be like an Atom Cat, use 'the ways of the cool' to influence others, let them be cooler and make Commonwealth the Tower of Coolness of the Wasteland. This is how you will be truly strong."
Dialog_Level28010100_119,Ku? What is ku?
Dialog_Level28010100_120,Join the Atom Cats! We will teach you how to be cool!
Dialog_Level28010100_121,Strong don't want be cat!
Dialog_Level28010100_122,"Uh, whatever you like my friend. But you're welcome to visit the Atom Cat Garage any time, we will let you experience what coolness really is!"
Dialog_Level28010300_101,"Strong, we can't accompany you any longer if we don't find 'milk' soon, we have some very important things to do."
Dialog_Level28010300_102,"Good humans leave, Strong find milk alone."
Dialog_Level28010300_103,"Don't worry, Strong, you will find milk. First, let's deal with these broken robots, this is a dangerous place."
Dialog_Level28010300_104,Strong smash metal men!
Dialog_Level28010300_105,"Back off civilians, the Brotherhood is carrying out a mission......uh, wait. Did you bring a Super Mutant with you?"
Dialog_Level28010300_106,"That's right, his name is Strong."
Dialog_Level28010300_107,Why are you with this monster?
Dialog_Level28010300_108,"Strong look for milk, Milk of Human Kindness! Strong get stronger after drinking it! Good humans help Strong look for milk!"
Dialog_Level28010300_109,"(Whispers) Shh, Strong, the Brotherhood of steel don't like mutants."
Dialog_Level28010300_110,"Ah, I get it now. You must be that famous 'milk freak' the raiders have been talking about, 'Milk of Human Kindness' can make you stronger, from 'Macbeth', hahaha......I get it, I get it."
Dialog_Level28010300_111,What is funny? Strong find milk!
Dialog_Level28010300_112,"Monsters are monsters......fine, let me solve your problem."
Dialog_Level28010300_113,"Look at this, this is an auto milk vending machine the Brotherhood recycled from a past mission, you can drink milk whenever you want. With this at hand, you'll have endless supplies of milk, hahaha......"
Dialog_Level28010300_114,"Wait, are you mocking Strong's int......"
Dialog_Level28010300_115,Real milk!
Dialog_Level28010300_116,(Gets milk from vending machine and downs it) Strong feel stronger! Thank you good human!
Dialog_Level28010300_117,Uh......
Dialog_Level28010300_118,Uh......
Dialog_Level28010200_101,"Looks like this place has been taken over by the Triggermen, they're everywhere, just like Radroaches."
Dialog_Level28010200_102,"(Speakerphone) Intruders! You have entered the Triggermen's territory, it seems you don't want to go back alive!"
Dialog_Level28010200_103,(Speakerphone) I bet our boss's voice made them pee their pants!
Dialog_Level28010200_104,"(Speakerphone) Silence! Don't ruin my opening scene!......Ahem, intruders, have you decided how you're going to die?"
Dialog_Level28010200_105,"Uh, this is new."
Dialog_Level28010200_106,"Hey, we just want to talk, has anyone strange been here?"
Dialog_Level28010200_107,(Speakerphone) Talk? The dead have no right to talk!
Dialog_Level28010200_108,(Speakerphone) That's right! We're not going to tell you that a weird mutant old man came here before......
Dialog_Level28010200_109,"(Speakerphone) Shut up, Steve, are you an idiot? Ahem, let me say this again, the dead have not right to talk!"
Dialog_Level28010200_110,It seems we'll have to talk to them 'face to face.'
Dialog_Level28010200_111,"(Speakerphone) Hahahaha, you will face my strongest combat troops 'the reapers', you are all dead!"
Dialog_Level28010200_112,That's a good name though.
Dialog_Level28010200_113,(Speakerphone) Boss......
Dialog_Level28010200_114,(Speakerphone) What? I told you not to ruin my scene!
Dialog_Level28010200_115,(Speakerphone) You sent 'the reapers' out this morning......there's only 'the sweepers' here.
Dialog_Level28010200_116,(Speakerphone) 'The sweepers?' What are they for?
Dialog_Level28010200_117,"(Speakerphone) Like their name suggests, they are basically janitors......"
Dialog_Level28010200_118,(Speakerphone) No—
Dialog_Level28010200_119,"Right, now can we talk about that 'weird old man?'"
Dialog_Level28010200_120,No! Get ready to taste my fury!
Dialog_Level28010200_121,"B......boss, that old man left a Holotape, it's useless to us, let's just give it to them."
Dialog_Level28010200_122,"Shut up, Steve!"
Dialog_Level28010200_123,You should listen to Steve.
Dialog_Level28010200_124,Shut up! Shut up! You want that Holotape? Over our dead bodies!
Dialog_Level28010200_125,That could be arranged.
Dialog_Level28010200_126,Darn it......
Dialog_Level28010200_127,"We finally took care of the idiots. Look, this is the Holotape, let's listen to Jacob's Holotape."
Dialog_Level28010200_128,"""Have to......quickly......sanity is......losing......"""
Dialog_Level28010200_129,"""Separating the FEV container......has failed......accident......can't remember......"""
Dialog_Level28010200_130,"""Only remember......Vera......telling me......if she fails......"""
Dialog_Level28010200_131,"""Can go to the Glowing Sea......to find someone......called Virgil......"""
Dialog_Level28010200_132,"""Jacob March......I'm Jacob......"""
Dialog_Level28010200_133,"""Ahead......Vault 95......need supplies......"""
Dialog_Level28010200_134,"""Anger......confusion......fear......uncontrollable......"""
Dialog_Level28010200_135,"Darn......he's probably heading towards the Glowing Sea, looking for someone called Virgil."
Dialog_Level28010200_136,"Plus, his mutation is deteriorating, we......might be too late."
Dialog_Level28010200_137,"The worst news is that we cannot cross the Glowing Sea easily, the radiation there is lethal to normal people."
Dialog_Level28010200_138,What do we do? What do we do?
Dialog_Level28010200_139,"Keep calm, we can think about it when we get back. We should leave before more Triggermen come here."
Dialog_Level28010400_101,"You're finally here, now we can start the next step."
Dialog_Level28010400_102,"A very long time ago, General Atomics Factory was a well known producer of fusion robots. I've sent Synths to look into this, we should be able to find some protection suits that we can wear in order to pass the Glowing Sea."
Dialog_Level28010400_103,"But first, we need to take care of some uncontrolled robots."
Dialog_Level28010400_104,Got it.
Dialog_Level28010400_105,"I will distract those robots with my Synths, you can use this opportunity to sneak out."
Dialog_Level28010400_106,"But I have to add to that. There's a sentry bot guarding the protection suits, that guy is not easy to deal with."
Dialog_Level28010400_107,"The Synths I sent out before are all dead, it's down to you to deal with this guy."
Dialog_Level28010400_108,This metal ball must be protecting those protection suits we need.
Dialog_Level28010400_109,Then what are we waiting for?
Dialog_Level28010400_110,These should be the protection suits.
Dialog_Level28010400_111,"Brilliant, you saved me a lot of trouble."
Dialog_Level28010400_112,"I think we all know what will happen next, Nick. You can't really think that I'm stupid enough to believe that you will work with me."
Dialog_Level28010400_113,Darn it! He took the protection suits! What now?
Dialog_Level28010400_114,"He won't go far. I made a little tweak to our tracking device, we'll track him no matter where he goes."
Dialog_Level28010400_115,"Look! He's still nearby, he probably wants to escape by using the transmitter, let's get him!"
Dialog_Level28010400_116,"You're more persistent than I imagined, Nick."
Dialog_Level28010400_117,"I may be a Synth, but don't compare me with the other trash. You mess with the best, you die like the rest!"
Dialog_Level28010400_118,"How ironic, you were once a part of the Institute, but now you're risking your life for a bunch of white mice."
Dialog_Level28010400_119,"You can't make me angry, Kellogg. My heart is Synthesized."
Dialog_Level28010400_120,"You leave me no choice, let's settle this the hard way then."
Dialog_Level28010400_121,LET'S GET IT ON!
Dialog_Level28010400_122,"*Cough*......*cough*......you win......kill me now, just end this!"
Dialog_Level28010400_123,"Poor guy, maybe the Institute never really believed him."
Dialog_Level28010400_124,*Cough*......ha......because I'm also......just a little white mouse of theirs.
Dialog_Level28010400_125,"You should live, only by living will you have a chance to find the meaning of existence in the Wasteland."
Dialog_Level28010400_126,Haha......*cough*......this is probably......the funniest joke......I've ever......heard......
Dialog_Level28010400_127,"Let's go, we've got the protection suits, and Kellogg won't be causing any more trouble."
Dialog_Level28010400_128,"Bye, Kellogg."
Dialog_Level28010400_129,Hahaha......*cough*......bye.
Dialog_Level27010110_101,"Nick, you seem on edge. What's going on?"
Dialog_Level27010110_102,"Yeah, we've got the Protection Suit for the Glowing Sea. That darn nuisance Kellogg won't stand in our way. Be happy."
Dialog_Level27010110_103,I wonder how you can see anxiety on a mechanical face like mine.....
Dialog_Level27010110_104,"Alright, let's get to the point. Since the moment we approached, I've had this feeling someone's watching over us. It makes me...uncomfortable..."
Dialog_Level27010110_105,Making the great detective uneasy... That must be a tough one!
Dialog_Level27010110_201,It's synths from the Institute!
Dialog_Level27010110_202,What are these broken scraps doing here? What's the Institute up to this time?
Dialog_Level27010110_203,After them!
Dialog_Level27010110_301,Good. Now let's see what these sneaky jerks are hiding!
Dialog_Level27010110_302,"I see... They are the second generation, eyes and ears of the Institute."
Dialog_Level27010110_303,Their communicators are intact. Perhaps we could access to their last message and find out what they were up to.
Dialog_Level27010110_304,"Leave it to me, after all I'm from the Institute, it will be a piece of cake."
Dialog_Level27010110_305,E2-47...you're exposed. Stop contact with Vault dwellers... Repeat... Stop contact with Vault dwellers and withdraw at once.
Dialog_Level27010110_306,"According to the information we collected, Vault dwellers are one step away from successfully tracking down Overseer Jacob March...which benefits us on the surface... Keep distance and void contact...Repeat: Keep distance..."
Dialog_Level27010110_307,Seems the Institute has been observing us in the dark. Kellogg is but one of their chess pieces.
Dialog_Level27010110_308,What the hell do they want? Why are they always so sneaky?
Dialog_Level27010110_309,You should know that's all they do. Hide in the dark and never show their true purpose until the last moment.
Dialog_Level27010110_310,We got rid of their spies this time. But what about next time? We'd better be careful.
Dialog_Level27010110_311,You've got a point. We have no time to play with them.
Dialog_Level20010110_101,Halt! Drop down your weapons.
Dialog_Level20010110_102,It's a trap! We were caught off guard!
Dialog_Level20010110_103,(Whisper) What now? Break out? It doesn't look good for us.
Dialog_Level20010110_104,"(Gestures to stop) The Hunters from the Institute, what do you want from us?"
Dialog_Level20010110_105,"Hello, Vault dwellers, long time no see. I have something to tell you."
Dialog_Level20010110_106,What's the matter? Can't you just send a message to our radio station?
Dialog_Level20010110_107,Don't be so mean. I'm here to help... At least you should hear me out.
Dialog_Level20010110_108,The Institute knows everything about you. We know you and Kellogg had a little...conflict. And we know your Overseer has been infected with the FEV and does not have long to live.
Dialog_Level20010110_109,"Honestly, I don't care who wins between you and Kellogg. But judging from the result, seems you're perfect for this mission."
Dialog_Level20010110_110,"Since you've locked on to your Overseer's signal, the Institute will give you a portable teleporter which will allow you to transfer back to his signal in a blink of an eye."
Dialog_Level20010110_111,"Wait a sec, I guess it's not free of charge!"
Dialog_Level20010110_112,"When you meet Jacob, this teleporter will gather data FEV data from Jacob. You don't need to do anything complicated. Isn't it a good deal?"
Dialog_Level20010110_113,What do you want with the FEV data?
Dialog_Level20010110_114,"Um... I am under no obligation to tell you, but let's just say the Institute's interested in FEV research."
Dialog_Level20010110_115,Um...seems we have no choice... Fine.
Dialog_Level20010110_116,"Good, you can activate the teleporter in Natick where the signal is the strongest. That will work best."
Dialog_Level20010110_117,"Oh, right, don't forget it's the Institute that did you this favor. You owe us."
Dialog_Level19010110_101,"This is the where it all started, the singularity of the catastrophe... I never thought I'd see such sight... A terrible beauty."
Dialog_Level19010110_102,Nothing lives on the wasteland. Only the fallout that expands in the barren solitude.
Dialog_Level19010110_103,"Not really, we got mutant creatures here...and... Are those humans? How can they live here?"
Dialog_Level19010110_104,They are under attack by mutant creatures. We've got help them.
Dialog_Level19010110_201,"Gratitude, travelers. It must be the Atom's will that guided you here."
Dialog_Level19010110_202,"May the atomic power watch over you, sister. What happened here?"
Dialog_Level19010110_203,Nick just got superstitious...
Dialog_Level19010110_204,"Quiet, they're cultists worshiping the atomic power. They won't turn hostile as long as we respect their teachings."
Dialog_Level19010110_205,A mutant full of fear and anger passed through here and disturbed the nearby creatures. Many brothers and sisters regarded him as a sacrilege but I think his arrival is a trial to our atomic power.
Dialog_Level19010110_206,That mutant...might be our friend. He's bery sick and needs our help. The only clue we have is that he came to the Glowing Sea in search of someone named Virgil.
Dialog_Level19010110_207,I'm deeply sorry about your friend. I can't do anything to help him. Perhaps it's a trial for him set by the Atomic Power.
Dialog_Level19010110_208,"Thanks, Mother. May the Atomic Power be with you."
Dialog_Level19010110_301,"May the Atomic Power be with you, friend."
Dialog_Level19010110_302,You got my attention. Did the Institute send you?
Dialog_Level19010110_303,We... Are you a super mutant? I've never seen a mutant like you before...
Dialog_Level19010110_304,"You haven't answered my question yet. Seems you don't want to go back home, alive that is."
Dialog_Level19010110_305,"Come on, Virgil. We have a very sick friend who might come to you. We just need some information."
Dialog_Level19010110_306,"...I heard you. You are Nick Valentine, the synth detective from Diamond City. Seems you're not from the Institute... Sorry for my bad manners."
Dialog_Level19010110_307,I know the guy you're looking for... But he's in a very bad condition now.
Dialog_Level19010110_308,"He's severely infected with FEV. Last time I saw him, he was holding a suitcase tight and calling my name."
Dialog_Level19010110_309,Our friend thought you could help him. But we don't know why.
Dialog_Level19010110_310,I was an expert in FEV from the Institute. I fled here because I didn't want to continue those inhumane experiments.
Dialog_Level19010110_311,"To defend against the radiation of the Glowing Sea, I turned myself into a super mutant with a special FEV serum. My research now is to reverse the effects of FEV."
Dialog_Level19010110_312,I hope I could help him. But you see... My research hasn't been completed yet due to lack of something important...
Dialog_Level19010110_313,Your friend...suffers from a severe infection. He has totally lost his mind and headed deeper into the cave.
Dialog_Level19010110_314,"This is another type of serum I invented to maintain my mental condition. It may not cure your friend, but it could keep him clear-headed for a while."
Dialog_Level19010110_315,"As he's mentally unstable, he may not accept your injection. You'd better prepare for a tough fight. Due to his severe infection, I don't think the serum would last long anyway."
Dialog_Level19010110_316,"Sorry, I couldn't help much. Good luck."
Dialog_Level19010110_401,"That super mutant, could it be...?"
Dialog_Level19010110_402,(Shout) Jacob!
Dialog_Level19010110_403,Stay! Away! Jacob...can't control himself!
Dialog_Level19010110_404,Jacob! Calm down! We're helping you!
Dialog_Level19010110_405,Leave! Ja...cob! Alone!
Dialog_Level19010110_501,Urrrrgh...
Dialog_Level19010110_502,Now! Inject the serum!
Dialog_Level19010110_503,Where... Where is this place...?
Dialog_Level19010110_504,Take it easy. You just woke up from the mutation. We are friends from the Vault. We're here to help.
Dialog_Level19010110_505,"Help? No, you don't get it. I failed... It all was a plan..."
Dialog_Level19010110_506,"Cool off, we found your tapes. We know FEV in the Resource Purifier..."
Dialog_Level19010110_507,"The Resource Purifier... Yeah, right..."
Dialog_Level19010110_508,The cursed thing will hurt people no more!
Dialog_Level19010110_509,"What are you doing? Jacob, hold yourself! The Vault needs it. We could fix it!"
Dialog_Level19010110_510,Listen... If I ever got asked what I learned in this... That would be...cough...the wasteland never needs...cough...our rescue.
Dialog_Level19010110_511,"The minute I walked out of the Vault, all I could see is chaos and savages, radiated lands and mutant creatures everywhere... Cough... But...as I walked further, I saw...hope and future..."
Dialog_Level19010110_512,"Cough...cough... In my journey, I saw warriors in power suits fight for order. I saw new technologies trying to redefine ""human""."
Dialog_Level19010110_513,"I saw Diamond City, crowded with people from every corner of the wasteland, gathering to form a new civilization... Even in this silent and burning sea, I still recall humans used to live here..."
Dialog_Level19010110_514,They are right. New civilization is born wherever human reside.
Dialog_Level19010110_515,"The Wasteland never lacks hope... As long as you work together...cough... The Resource Purifier, the relic from two hundred years ago is infused with malice of ancient schemers. It brings no salvation..."
Dialog_Level19010110_516,You don't...need it...cough...to save the Wasteland... You...cough...only need to...trust each other...
Dialog_Level19010110_517,(Jacob exerted his last ounce of strength and crumbled the broken Resource Purifier with his huge mutant hand. The ancient device let out a dull creak and burst into a big blazing fire ball.)
Dialog_Level19010110_518,"(His body burning, reflected by the flames, Jacob managed a light smile on his swollen and hideous face. Then his eyes shut forever.)"
Dialog_Level19010110_519,He's dead...
Dialog_Level19010110_520,"I barely know this old man, but he's respectable. Perhaps this is the best ending for him. And his sacrifice and resolve shall bring true peace to the Vault."
Dialog_Level19010110_521,His Pip-Boy... It keeps information concerning the Capital Wasteland. Perhaps we may find a way to reverse FEV mutation there?
Dialog_Level19010110_522,"I don't know, friend. I can't tell what the journey ahead means to us. I don't even know if we could find the cure to FEV in the Capital Wasteland. But I'm sure what we could do now is to trust each other."
Dialog_Level19010120_101,This place brings back memories... I feel...upset...
Dialog_Level19010120_102,Thought I'd never be back here.
Dialog_Level19010120_103,"Travelers, we meet again. What is it this time?"
Dialog_Level19010120_104,"Hello, sister. We're here to say goodbye to Overseer Jacob who rests in peace here."
Dialog_Level19010120_105,"If it weren't for his sacrifice, our vault would have become a FEV lab."
Dialog_Level19010120_106,It's all guided by the Atomic Power. I'll tell my brothers and sisters to make way.
Dialog_Level19010120_107,I sense your journey will not end here... Good luck! The power of fission shall guide you.
Dialog_Level19010120_108,"Thanks, sister."
Dialog_Level19010120_109,This is where Jacob died...
Dialog_Level19010120_110,He brought peace to the Vault. Perhaps we don't need to worry anymore about the FEV.
Dialog_Level19010120_111,"But his Pip-Boy, those information about the Capital Wasteland... What do you say?"
Dialog_Level19010120_112,Perhaps we could find the cure to FEV in the Capital Wasteland?
Dialog_Level19010120_113,Maybe. But does it have anything to do with us? And it's far far away...
Dialog_Level19010120_114,(Serious) Of course it does!
Dialog_Level19010120_115,We can't live in peace as long as these evil experiments are still being conducted in some forgotten vault on the Wasteland!
Dialog_Level19010120_116,True peace comes only after we find the cure to FEV.
Dialog_Level19010120_117,For Jacob!
Dialog_Level19010120_118,For Jacob!
Dialog_Level19010120_119,Suppose you're right... But the Capital Wasteland is far away and dangerous with more serious radiation. Are we really prepared?
Dialog_Level19010120_120,Who knows? The Wasteland never lets you prepare. Thinking too much makes no difference.
Dialog_Level31010110_101,Here is the Capital Wasteland...? Doesn't look much different from the Commonwealth... Another barren land.
Dialog_Level31010110_102,That depends on what we encounter... The radiation here is much worse. Only the tough can survive here.
Dialog_Level31010110_103,Strangers! How dare you intrude the Republic of Dave? State your business or else!
Dialog_Level31010110_104,"Hey, easy, man..."
Dialog_Level31010110_105,We are travelers from the Commonwealth Wasteland. We're new here. And you?
Dialog_Level31010110_106,"What stands right before you is the president of Republic of Dave, Mr. Dave!"
Dialog_Level31010110_107,"Looks like you're not intruders. Strangers, I'll let the Secretary of State, namely myself, issue you a temporary visa that allows you to roam about my land during your visit."
Dialog_Level31010110_108,Phew... Thanks.
Dialog_Level31010110_109,"Um, Mr. President, I wonder what you, as such important person, are doing here in this god-forsaken place?"
Dialog_Level31010110_110,"Um...because...um... Well, I guess it doesn't hurt to tell you outlanders."
Dialog_Level31010110_111,Our big election day is coming. And this time...my approval rating is not very good... So I need some help to raise it.
Dialog_Level31010110_112,Oh... What are you gonna do?
Dialog_Level31010110_113,The easiest way is to start a war with my neighbor!
Dialog_Level31010110_114,What?
Dialog_Level31010110_115,You heard me. A war! That's the secret weapon of all presidents!
Dialog_Level31010110_116,I still don't get it. How could a war raise your popularity?
Dialog_Level31010110_117,"I'll go into more details... A war does not only serve as a diversion of economic plight, but also empowers me with ""the right of disposal in time of emergency""! The best deal ever!"
Dialog_Level31010110_118,"Um, speaking of it... Don't you wanna know about this place? If you outland corps help me win the election, the Republic of Dave would be your faithful ally. How does that sound?"
Dialog_Level31010110_119,Sounds...not bad...
Dialog_Level31010110_120,Great! Now help me fight a war against my neighbor!
Dialog_Level31010110_121,"My loyal and trustworthy outland corps, how's it going?"
Dialog_Level31010110_122,"What? Your ""neighbors"" are nothing but a bunch of Feral Ghouls..."
Dialog_Level31010110_123,The Kingdom of Ghouls! Their reign of terror has finally ended!
Dialog_Level31010110_124,I mean...
Dialog_Level31010110_125,We've brought them freedom and peace!
Dialog_Level31010110_126,(Sarcastically)Sure!
Dialog_Level31010110_127,"Alright, with this victory comes the spoils. Now we can freely harvest resources in ""the Kingdom of Ghouls"". Isn't it great?"
Dialog_Level31010110_128,What about their dwellers...?
Dialog_Level31010110_129,"Oh, don't worry. These ghouls may have lost everything, but they've got freedom!"
Dialog_Level31010110_130,(Sigh) War... War never changes...
Dialog_Level31010210_101,My dear outland corps... I have both a good news and a bad.
Dialog_Level31010210_102,Good news first.
Dialog_Level31010210_103,"Since our last campaign, my approval rate has been significantly increased...from 4 to 5!"
Dialog_Level31010210_104,What does 4 mean? 4%? 40%?
Dialog_Level31010210_105,Four supporters.
Dialog_Level31010210_106,...Bad news then...
Dialog_Level31010210_107,Lately a gang boss has come here and gained much support... I he's poseing a threat to my re-elections!
Dialog_Level31010210_108,So?
Dialog_Level31010210_109,"We must tarnish his name! Find out all his secrets! A gangster boss must have done something dirty, right?"
Dialog_Level31010210_110,It means?
Dialog_Level31010210_111,I means...I'll give you the honor of infiltrating his office and find something to use against him!
Dialog_Level31010210_112,"Oh, man, why are we always doing the dirty work?"
Dialog_Level31010210_113,Because that's what the election about!
Dialog_Level31010210_114,"This should be the office ""Mr. President"" talked about..."
Dialog_Level31010210_115,Hush! Easy... Let's just get the job done quickly...
Dialog_Level31010210_116,Who's there? How did you get in here?
Dialog_Level31010210_117,Eh...
Dialog_Level31010210_118,Um...
Dialog_Level31010210_119,Answer me! Or else I'll call the guards!
Dialog_Level31010210_120,Wait!
Dialog_Level31010210_121,"We don't want trouble. Your rival sent us here to find something against you. Just give us something, anything so we can get the job done."
Dialog_Level31010210_122,"Whatever it is! Seriously, we're not picky at all!"
Dialog_Level31010210_123,"What are you talking about?... Wait, you can't be talking about...the idiot from the Republic of Dave? Stop joking. I don't give a damn to his backwater village."
Dialog_Level31010210_124,So?
Dialog_Level31010210_125,So you must be lying! You must come to steal my goods! Guards! Guards!
Dialog_Level31010210_126,"(Sarcastically) Great, what now?"
Dialog_Level31010210_127,I heard something. What happened?
Dialog_Level31010210_128,As you can see.
Dialog_Level31010210_129,It's not a big deal. Don't worry.
Dialog_Level31010210_130,"Eh, what should we do?"
Dialog_Level31010210_131,"We can have a ""Press Conference"" and say this gangster boss was hiding some chemical weapons or bio-weapons whatever... And my special troops shot him dead."
Dialog_Level31010210_132,But...we need evidence! We found nothing there!
Dialog_Level31010210_133,It's okay. Just find a bag of washing powder or Seminta and say it's a chemical weapon... Why the look? Every great politician does it!
Dialog_Level31010510_101,"My dear outland corps, this a new record for my approval rating!"
Dialog_Level31010510_102,So our job's finished?
Dialog_Level31010510_103,"To be sure, we'd better increase it more."
Dialog_Level31010510_104,"I have another idea to increase it, establish a new colony!"
Dialog_Level31010510_105,I...don't get you.
Dialog_Level31010510_106,"Come on, why not? Just like what my ancestors did, expansion! Both romantic and epic!"
Dialog_Level31010510_107,There's a deserted camp nearby. Once we make it the new colony my approval rate will soar!
Dialog_Level31010510_108,"Well, fine!"
Dialog_Level31010510_109,"Wait, this doesn't look like a ""deserted camp""."
Dialog_Level31010510_110,He...llo? We're peaceful...travelers?
Dialog_Level31010510_111,Enemy spotted. Prepare for elimination.
Dialog_Level31010510_112,"Yes, sir! Understood!"
Dialog_Level31010510_113,Wait! We mean no harm!
Dialog_Level31010510_114,Fire!
Dialog_Level31010510_115,"Phew, that was close!"
Dialog_Level31010510_116,What's wrong with those soldiers? Their weapons are so advanced it's as if they are not of this world!
Dialog_Level31010510_117,Why did they attack us without a reason? Who the hell are they?
Dialog_Level31010510_118,"Oh, seems my loyal outland corps have taken the deserted camp! A new colony for the Republic of Dave!"
Dialog_Level31010510_119,"It's no ""deserted camp""! Some well-armed soldiers were stationed here! They were dangerous!"
Dialog_Level31010510_120,Take it easy. They are just some natives. Haven't you taken them out yet?
Dialog_Level31010510_121,But...
Dialog_Level31010510_122,"Don't worry. In memory of their sacrifice, we can make today a yearly holiday... Let's call it...""Gratitude Day""!"
Dialog_Level31010510_123,You did a perfect job. The election day is around the corner. We couldn't celebrate with you? Come to the Republic of Dave for the ceremony! I'll be waiting there for you!
Dialog_Level310106100_101,"Ah, my dear outland corps, perfect timing! With your help, my approval rate is now 100%!"
Dialog_Level310106100_102,Dave! Dave!
Dialog_Level310106100_103,Dave is the best!
Dialog_Level310106100_104,I heard Dave hasn't cried since he was born! And his poop doesn't smell bad!
Dialog_Level310106100_105,Um... That's too much...
Dialog_Level310106100_106,"People of the Republic of Dave! Thanks for your support! The reelection means a lot to me! As for new policies, I'll..."
Dialog_Level310106100_107,No! Emergency!
Dialog_Level310106100_108,What?
Dialog_Level310106100_109,The village... A... A deathclaw came! Help!
Dialog_Level310106100_110,"A deathclaw? Don't be afraid, everyone, Dave used to take down deathclaws with his bare hands. He will protect us!"
Dialog_Level310106100_111,Um... It's going a bit far...
Dialog_Level310106100_112,Bring it on! Dave will kick its butt!
Dialog_Level310106100_113,Um... Um...(Whisper) It's really...huge...
Dialog_Level310106100_114,Come on! My love! Show it what a president can do!
Dialog_Level310106100_115,Um... I just forgot my lucky knife is in my home. So long!
Dialog_Level310106100_116,Dave? Mr. President?
Dialog_Level310106100_117,Ahhhh! Help!
Dialog_Level310106100_118,"Guess this is where our ""outland corps"" are needed."
Dialog_Level310106100_119,Finished? Great.( Clear throat) People of the Republic! It's safe now. My outland corps have defeated the deathclaw!
Dialog_Level310106100_120,"We're not for you anymore, Dave! You didn't kill a deathclaw! It must be a Brahmin!"
Dialog_Level310106100_121,But...
Dialog_Level310106100_122,Liar!
Dialog_Level310106100_123,Coward!
Dialog_Level310106100_124,You can't protect the Republic!
Dialog_Level310106100_125,But...
Dialog_Level310106100_126,We need a new president!
Dialog_Level310106100_127,Revote! Revote!
Dialog_Level310106100_128,"Seems the election went...a bit wrong... Travelers, could you excuse us?"
Dialog_Level310106100_129,But we had a deal with Dave. If we help him with the approval rating he would be our guild for this area. We help him with the rate. He will be our guide for these parts
Dialog_Level310106100_130,"But it's a total mess now... How about this? I heard you're from a vault, right? Vault 92 is not far to the west. Perhaps you should try your luck there?"
Dialog_Level310106100_131,"Sigh, it leaves us no choice. Seems it's hard to be a president!"
Dialog_Level32010110_101,Is this Vault 92? It looks like it has been deserted for a long time.
Dialog_Level32010110_102,I heard many were used for horrible experiments. That's probably what happened here.
Dialog_Level32010110_103,"Our vault was no exception... Fortunately, Jacob figured out the scheme early."
Dialog_Level32010110_104,Guess the dwellers here weren't so lucky.
Dialog_Level32010110_105,...Let's go. It's not the time to grieve.
Dialog_Level32010110_106,"(Whisper) Hush, careful. We got company."
Dialog_Level32010110_107,(Whisper) ...Aren't these guys the weird soldiers we met before?
Dialog_Level32010110_108,"(Whisper) Right, seems they haven't noticed us. Let's eavesdrop on them."
Dialog_Level32010110_109,"Copy this experiment data. Hurry, you only got 5 minutes."
Dialog_Level32010110_110,"But... Sir, many of them are broken. It takes time to fix."
Dialog_Level32010110_111,"No excuses! Don't forget we're the Enclave, elites among humans! You can get it done quickly, can't you?"
Dialog_Level32010110_112,"Yes! Yes, sir!"
Dialog_Level32010110_113,"Good. Move your butt... Wait, I heard something."
Dialog_Level32010110_114,(Whisper) Crap!
Dialog_Level32010110_115,Someone's after us! Exterminate these guys! No prisoners!
Dialog_Level32010110_116,Phew... These guys are tough...
Dialog_Level32010110_117,For...Enclave...
Dialog_Level32010110_118,Watch out!!
Dialog_Level32010110_119,Cough... It's...gas grenade...
Dialog_Level32010110_120,I... I can't see... Cough...
Dialog_Level32010110_121,Calm down. Follow me!
Dialog_Level32010110_122,Where... am I? Who are you?
Dialog_Level32010110_123,Name's Hannibal. I've been tracking you for some time. You're safe now...well relatively...
Dialog_Level32010110_124,Tracking...?
Dialog_Level32010110_125,This is no place to talk. Join me at the Temple of the Union to the south. I'll explain what trouble you've got yourselves into.
Dialog_Level32010110_126,Um... Cough... Well...
Dialog_Level32010310_101,"Here we are, Hannibal. I gotta admit this place is quite special."
Dialog_Level32010310_102,"Not only ""special"", it's a symbol of our resistance. Allow me to introduce myself, Hannibal Hamlin, creator and leader of the Abolitionists."
Dialog_Level32010310_103,Nice to see you.
Dialog_Level32010310_104,The Capital Wasteland is a savage place where many brutes force others to be their slaves. Our little organization was founded to oppose these jerks.
Dialog_Level32010310_105,Have high hopes... You'll make it one day... But could you tell how you were able to following us?
Dialog_Level32010310_106,"We abolitionists know everything about this area. So when our scouts reported a group of travelers followed Enclave soldiers into Vault 92, I knew somthing bad would happen."
Dialog_Level32010310_107,"So I followed you into Vault 92... To be honest, I never thought you'd survive an Enclave attack. Impressive indeed."
Dialog_Level32010310_108,"Speaking of it, is there anything you could tell us about the ""Enclave""?"
Dialog_Level32010310_109,"I'm afraid I know not much about them. They seem to be descendants of government elites, possessing technologies beyond wastelanders' imagination. But they will attack all factions and creatures in the wasteland..."
Dialog_Level32010310_110,"Sometimes you hear some ""inspiring"" speeches delivered by their ""president""... But I bet most wastelanders have no idea what he's talking about... They would just take it as pure nonsense."
Dialog_Level32010310_111,"President? Oh my, not again..."
Dialog_Level32010310_112,That's right. Most people hate the Enclave...
Dialog_Level32010310_113,Somebody's home?!
Dialog_Level32010310_114,What's going on?
Dialog_Level32010310_115,"Alas, the guy's coming again..."
Dialog_Level32010310_116,"The Roach King is a madman living nearby and keeps many radiated roaches as pets. We've been living in peace, but lately he begins to harass us...constantly..."
Dialog_Level32010310_117,Not harassment. This is holy war! My lieutenant shall rip you two-footed monsters apart!
Dialog_Level32010310_118,Go! Edgar!
Dialog_Level32010310_119,We have no time for this madman. Somebody's gotta deal with him.
Dialog_Level32010310_120,Leave it to us.
Dialog_Level32010310_121,Really?
Dialog_Level32010310_122,"Of course, we vault dwellers have been working as hired hands."
Dialog_Level32010310_123,"Good. If you could ensure that the Roach King will never disturb anyone again, we abolitionists shall be your firmest shield in the Capital Wasteland."
Dialog_Level32010310_124,"Deal! It's time to have an ""audience"" with the king."
Dialog_Level32010510_101,"Ah, two-footed monsters finally come to invade my land!"
Dialog_Level32010510_102,Um... Aren't you one of us?
Dialog_Level32010510_103,Shut up! I'm a roach! Roach! Roach got six feet!
Dialog_Level32010510_104,"Yeah, no need to be so loud... fine fine your a Roach."
Dialog_Level32010510_105,"Your Majesty, could you leave the Temple of the Union alone? They... the two-footed monsters think they did nothing against you..."
Dialog_Level32010510_106,Liar! Rats! You two-footed monsters are all the same!
Dialog_Level32010510_107,Honestly I don't see what we did to offend you...
Dialog_Level32010510_108,"Two-footed monsters, especially those bastards clad in armor, they always take my children away for experiments!"
Dialog_Level32010510_109,"Only if I take all these parts and get rid of all the two-footed monsters, can my kingdom be strong enough to protect my children!"
Dialog_Level32010510_110,We can't argue with a madman!
Dialog_Level32010510_111,For...my...children!
Dialog_Level32010510_112,Seems the king should be good for a while.
Dialog_Level32010510_113,"Poof, hail the king!"
Dialog_Level32010510_114,Good job. The madman will trouble us no more.
Dialog_Level32010510_115,Thanks for your help. The abolitionists will watch your back from now on.
Dialog_Level32010510_116,Thanks. We're glad to have company in the Capital Wasteland.
Dialog_Level32010510_117,I'm still thinking of the Enclave. I feel an encounter will be inevitable within the Capital Wasteland.
Dialog_Level32010510_118,But they are hiding in the dark with better weapons and armor. How could we fight them?
Dialog_Level32010510_119,"Honestly, I can't figure out a better way. But I know the answer might be found somewhere."
Dialog_Level32010510_120,"There's a place called ""Oasis"" not far to the west. I heard there's a ""Talking Tree"" that knows everything. If we want to seek answers, ""Oasis"" would be a good place to start."
Dialog_Level32010510_121,"Hold on... You mean a ""Talking Tree""? Are you serious?"
Dialog_Level32010510_122,"(Shrug) Welcome to the Capital Wasteland, buddy!"
Dialog_Level26010100_101,It's obvious that the signal is leading us somewhere.
Dialog_Level26010100_102,"Yes, it's very clear, but where exactly?"
Dialog_Level26010100_103,"The signal stopped there, it must be it."
Dialog_Level26010100_104,"And here comes another problem, where would the signal stop?"
Dialog_Level26010100_105,"Don't know, we want to find it and see."
Dialog_Level26010100_106,"Great, the situation seems very clear, yet we still don't know anything and are searching endlessly."
Dialog_Level26010100_107,"From what this looks like, will all of this before nothing again?"
Dialog_Level26010100_108,.....not entirely.
Dialog_Level26010100_109,How so?
Dialog_Level26010100_110,I found a comic called 'Grognak the Barbarian'
Dialog_Level26010100_111,What! Your so lucky!
Dialog_Level26010100_112,Of course! I was searching every nook and cranny while you were just being lazy.
Dialog_Level26010100_113,"......fine, I get it."
Dialog_Level26010300_101,"Seems the signal stopped here, in the land of freedom."
Dialog_Level26010300_102,"What, did it run out of road?"
Dialog_Level26010300_103,"More like it has reached its destination, and is waiting for us to find it."
Dialog_Level26010300_104,Then we shouldn't let it down. Let's go! Let's go find it!
Dialog_Level26010300_105,How......how could it be you? Shaun?
Dialog_Level26010300_106,"Don't be surprised, I was just waiting for you."
Dialog_Level26010300_107,Then the signal that led us here is......
Dialog_Level26010300_108,"Oh, it's just a trick I learned from the Synths."
Dialog_Level26010300_109,"That means you're the one who led us here. Ok, let's hear it, what do you want?"
Dialog_Level26010300_110,"Actually, I'm just keeping a promise."
Dialog_Level26010300_111,Huh? What do you mean?
Dialog_Level26010300_112,"Your Overseer met us once, and we came to an agreement."
Dialog_Level26010300_113,What...?
Dialog_Level26010300_114,He was heading towards the Glowing Sea long before you arrived at east Boston. And we lured you to the north by his request.
Dialog_Level26010300_115,What...what...what does this mean?
Dialog_Level26010300_116,"He has his plans, and he doesn't want you to get involved. He should have finished by now, so I came looking for you."
Dialog_Level26010300_117,"Ok, now that I have lived up to my words. What you do henceforth is completely up to you. I bid you GOOD DAY."
Broadcast_Level5010300_101,Look! The Raiders that robbed the settlement are just ahead of us!
Broadcast_Level5010300_102,Great! Let's give them an experience they'll never forget.
Broadcast_Level5010300_103,Hey! Scumbags! Hand over all your valuables!
Broadcast_Level5010300_104,Hahaha! Did I hear that correctly? Someone wants to rob the Iron Wolves?
Broadcast_Level5010300_105,"Hahaha! That's right, you bunch of pansies!"
Broadcast_Level5010300_106,You fools! We are iron Wolves! Make them suffer..!!
Broadcast_Level5010300_107,"Reality is, even the toughest of them can be defeated."
Broadcast_Level5010300_108,"......Ok, ok, clean this up quickly and let's go back to the Vault, we got a ton of loot this time!"
Broadcast_Level5010300_109,"Ahahaha! Plentiful, plentiful!"
Broadcast_Level6010200_101,Listen! Do you hear anything strange?
Broadcast_Level6010200_102,"Don't be nervous, I don't hear anything."
Broadcast_Level6010200_103,"Don't just use your ears, use all your senses..."
Broadcast_Level6010200_104,...What can you hear then?
Broadcast_Level6010200_105,I hear treasure!
Broadcast_Level6010200_106,Liar.
Broadcast_Level6010200_107,See! What did I say? The sound of treasure!
Broadcast_Level6010200_108,...maybe you're right.
Broadcast_Level6010200_109,Of course I am! Hahaha!
Broadcast_Level6010200_110,Looks like we'll need to give you a full body exam to understand where this ability of yours is coming from......
Broadcast_Level6010200_111,"No! No! That was just for fun, don't be so serious."
Broadcast_Level6010200_112,Look! A Mole Rat! It's one of those treasure digging ones! Quick! Don't let it run away!
Broadcast_Level1601400_101,"I heard someone is collecting intel on the Wasteland, and that they'd reward people that participate in their survey."
Broadcast_Level1601400_102,"It's a bit suspicious, could it be...an Enclave's spy?"
Broadcast_Level1601400_103,"It's the Enclave, but it's a shame that they passed away many years ago. It's said that those people just want to more research."
Broadcast_Level1601400_104,"Oh well, let's check it out, I'm pretty good with surveys."
Broadcast_Level1601400_105,It's a rare opportunity! We have to get the rewards!
Broadcast_Level22010200_101,Listen up guys! We just received information that the Feral Ghouls are going crazy! We have to give it our all!
Broadcast_Level22010200_102,Ok ok. But why are we here?
Broadcast_Level22010200_103,For the Commonwealth......
Broadcast_Level22010200_104,"Uh, I'm not dumb, tell me the truth."
Broadcast_Level22010200_105,Hm......the rich people from Diamond City are willing to help pay to solve this potential crisis.
Broadcast_Level22010200_106,"Why didn't you say so? Let's go then! People from the Vault never ask where the problem is, we only ask how much the pay is."
Dialog_Misson1002_101,"Now, we have to make a big decision! This decision will determine the sustainability of the Vault. Tell us big guy..."
Dialog_Misson1002_102,"Well, let me make an introduction. According to the original engineering structure of your Vault, the development of the Vault depends on the Resource Purifier."
Dialog_Misson1002_103,"For example, the Vault is a machine, and the Resource Purifier is the core regulator which helps the machine stabilize the input and the output of the energy."
Dialog_Misson1002_104,"No matter how big the machine is, the core regulator can maintain the energy balance. But now the trouble is that without the Resource Purifier, the stable structure of the Vault doesn't exist."
Dialog_Misson1002_105,"As a result, the bigger the Vault develops the more unstable it becomes and the more likely it collapses as a whole, unless the Vault remains the same size."
Dialog_Misson1002_106,"Obviously, we can't let that happen!"
Dialog_Misson1002_107,"So, I have an idea which is a little bit dangerous but technically feasible..."
Dialog_Misson1002_108,"Firstly, I'll revise the Overseer's Office's system and bypass the reliance of the Vault's reliance on the Resource Purifier. Of course, it is temporary, and this revision can be adjusted back at any time."
Dialog_Misson1002_109,"When the central system of the Vault doesn't depend on the Resource Purifier, the balance of the Vault will depend on each Vault building."
Dialog_Misson1002_110,"It's like building blocks, and we all need to make sure that there are enough Vault buildings to achieve overall stability before we develop the Vault and upgrade the Overseer's Office in the future."
Dialog_Misson1002_111,"In that way, enough buildings are used to ensure engineering balance, and then the Overseer's Office is upgraded to increase the system capacity. Continue this loop and the Vault can be developed."
Dialog_Misson1002_112,"I think is a good idea, and we don't have any better choices. If you agree with this idea, the big guy will adjust and upgrade our Overseer's Office."
Dialog_Misson1002_113,Well...The adjustment of the Overseer's Office is complete! I think...I didn't make a mistake and everything was successful.
Dialog_Misson1002_114,"Great, big guy! I think you are the coolest guy in this Vault!"
Dialog_Misson1002_115,"I'm glad to hear that. Since the stable structure of the Vault now depends on the building, I suggest that we should build a Research Room to study the performance of the building."
Dialog_Misson1002_116,No problem!
Dialog_Misson1011_101,"Listen, even though the efficiency of the production facilities have increased, the management cables can't keep up and are unable to issue prompt orders."
Dialog_Misson1011_102,"Upgrade the facilities in the Overseer's Office to improve the situation. This task is simple, but if you screw up, you will be disqualified as the successor!"
Dialog_Misson1011_201,"Darn, you actually did it. I even told the idiots to mess up the cables..."
Dialog_Misson1012_101,"Good job, son. Reports from the management computer show that you have done well."
Dialog_Misson1012_102,"Keep this up, and you will soon join management. Heh heh."
Dialog_Misson1012_103,"You must be tired. Go rest, there's more work tomorrow. Sweet dreams."
Dialog_Misson1034_101,"More fresh recruits. The Power Generator needs more manpower, station him there."
Dialog_Misson1101_101,This is a disaster! How did the Vault door open?! The Overseer is missing! The Resource Purifier is missing too! A rookie is taking over the Vault! My god... we're doomed...
Dialog_Misson1101_102,"Wait! There is a group of armed people in tattered outfits by the door, what do they want? You... you're in charge now. Go talk to them, I'm going back to protect the others."
Dialog_Misson1101_103,"Hi there, don't be scared. We are the Minutemen. If the radio in your Vault still works, you should have heard our broadcast before."
Dialog_Misson1101_104,Our patrol team reported there is abnormal personnel activities here. We discovered your Vault and the door is wide open. Is there a problem with the door? Want help repairing?
Dialog_Misson1101_105,"Don't worry. We are not Raiders. We just want to provide you with some assistance and welcome you to the big Wasteland family. It's tough here, you'll get used to it."
Dialog_Misson1101_106,"Oh... that means... one of your people suddenly opened the door and left the Vault. You want to go after him, then our patrol team might be able to help."
Dialog_Misson1101_107,"And your Vault is lacking the Resource Purifier, you'll need an engineer more than ever. How about this, Sturges, you stay and help."
Dialog_Misson1101_108,"As long as you don't object, I can always help."
Dialog_Misson1101_109,Then I will scout around. I will return to help when you are ready to head out to search.
Dialog_Misson1102_101,"We need to train the dwellers based on their skills. A large storage of clean water is a must, notify the water plant to start preparations."
Dialog_Misson1102_201,"Good, even though there is a metallic taste, we can produce large amounts of clean water now."
Dialog_Misson1103_101,The Minutemen patrol team reported that someone is camped at Red Rocket Truck Stop. The person's appearance matches with the Ex-Overseer. We should check it out.
Dialog_Misson1103_201,"This dog is quite smart, better than some humans... Come boy, come back with me."
Dialog_Misson1103_202,Woof Woof Woof! (Dogmeat happily wags his tail.)
Dialog_Misson1103_203,Heh... such a good dog.
Dialog_Misson1104_101,"Now that we have friends in the Wasteland, we need a broadcast station to keep in touch."
Dialog_Misson1104_201,Well done. Amplify the signal... adjust the wavelength... that's it! We can now receive and process the signals on the Wasteland.
Dialog_Misson1105_101,Fizz fizz fizzzzz... can you hear me? Fizz fizzzzz... this is Preston of the Minutemen... the signal is weak... fizz...
Dialog_Misson1105_102,"That's better. It's me, Preston, we ran into some, er, trouble."
Dialog_Misson1105_103,"We want to clear out the Radroaches in the Museum of Freedom, but their numbers are far more than we expected, we are shorthanded..."
Dialog_Misson1105_104,"If you can provide some support, the Minutemen will never forget it. We can help you in the future too. That settles it."
Dialog_Misson1105_201,That was close. Don't know where the Deathclaw came from. Good thing it's no longer a threat.
Dialog_Misson1105_202,"Thank you very much for your help. Once we are done building the base, the Minutemen can spare some men to help you."
Dialog_Misson1106_101,Have you noticed? The enhanced equipment of your men consumed materials as well as Wasteland currency...
Dialog_Misson1106_102,That's right! Bottle Caps! Cap are used as currency. They are essential for trading with other factions. Understand? We also need to build a Caps recycling center.
Dialog_Misson1106_201,Good. We can we can buy more materials from Wasteland savages to upgrade our equipment.
Dialog_Misson1107_101,"Hello. Sorry to bother you, but the Minutemen have run into a serious threat."
Dialog_Misson1107_102,"Our old rival, the mercenary group called ""Gunners, "" are harassing us again."
Dialog_Misson1107_103,"They have occupied the quarry and asking our whereabouts. The Minutemen will not sit idle, we will take the first step"
Dialog_Misson1107_104,"But we just established a foothold at the Museum of Freedom. Our forces are spread thin, we need your help."
Dialog_Misson1107_201,"Thanks for helping us, kid. Even though I knew you'd help, your performance far exceeded my expectations."
Dialog_Misson1107_202,"I know you are searching for something, but you might not like the answer you find."
Dialog_Misson1107_203,"Whatever happens, I know you will persist until the end. Go to Drumlin Diner, my ""vision"" told me you will discover some new things there. ."
Dialog_Misson1201_101,"Not bad so far, but of course, it is all because of my pointers and guidance."
Dialog_Misson1201_102,"Some good news for you. According to the analysis of the pre-war data you collected, we think that there are still functional Mr. Handys at Super Duper Mart."
Dialog_Misson1201_103,These robots provide good labor and don't get tired. It is essential that you bring them back in one piece.
Dialog_Misson1201_201,"Greetings, master. Your wish is my command."
Dialog_Misson1202_101,"Overseer, I can gather resources from locations that have been cleared. Please give your orders."
Dialog_Misson1202_102,"Please note: the more investigations you have done at this location, the more resources I can find."
Dialog_Misson1203_101,We have good news for you. The patrol team reported that a hostage escaped Drumlin Diner with valuable intel.
Dialog_Misson1203_102,"A man locked up with him claimed he is from a Vault, maybe he is your missing friend."
Dialog_Misson1203_103,"Be extra careful, the Gunners are the largest mercenary organization in Commonwealth. They will do anything for money."
Dialog_Misson1203_201,"Thank you for saving us. If you come to the Combat Zone, I will give you a free entrance ticket."
Dialog_Misson1203_202,"Looks like the intel is bad... At least we did not leave empty-handed, ha ha."
Dialog_Misson1204_101,"Hi! Friends from the Vault, I have some news about that old man you were looking for."
Dialog_Misson1204_102,Wonderful! What's the news?
Dialog_Misson1204_103,"Sources say that the person you are looking for appeared near Sunshine Tidings Co-Op, he seemed to be looking for something..."
Dialog_Misson1204_104,Okay! We will hurry there.
Dialog_Misson1205_101,Darn... looks like we are too late. The former Overseer has already left the Sunshine Tidings Co-Op...
Dialog_Misson1205_102,"Oh, what a pity. Rest assured, we will continue to hunt down information for you."
Dialog_Misson1205_103,"Okay, thank you!"
Dialog_Misson1206_101,"Hi guys! What a coincidence, running into you guys again in such a short time."
Dialog_Misson1206_102,"Oh, you're the one we rescued from Drumlin Diner..."
Dialog_Misson1206_103,"Yes ma'am, that's me. I am in your debt, I want to know how I can be of service."
Dialog_Misson1206_104,"Hmm... all right. We're actually looking for someone, maybe you can help. Here's the gist..."
Dialog_Misson1206_105,"Oh, is that so? I believe I still have some connections within the Wasteland. They should be able to provide some information."
Dialog_Misson1206_106,"That's wonderful! If you do find something, please let us know."
Dialog_Misson1206_107,"Don't worry, ma'am."
Dialog_Misson1206_201,There is a Holotape in this terminal... it has our Vault's logo. Did the Overseer leave this for us?
Dialog_Misson1206_202,"From the contents, it appears to be his diary after he left the Vault. The last entry is... just a few days ago."
Dialog_Misson1206_203,Gosh! The diary entries show that the Overseer is in poor health! Then why did he leave the Vault?
Dialog_Misson1206_204,"Even more so, he took the Resource Purifier with him!"
Dialog_Misson1206_205,"Regardless, we can only get answers by finding him."
Dialog_Misson91044_101,"The radio studio reported that someone seems to be sending a message, but the signal is too weak and is difficult to hear."
Dialog_Misson91044_102,You should arrange for an upgrade to the antenna and signal frequency devices in the Radio Studio so we don't miss any chances to find the Ex-Overseer.
Dialog_Misson91044_201,The Radio Studio upgrade is complete. Begin searching new frequencies... attention! We received a message!
Dialog_Misson91044_202,"... need help! I'm trapped by mutants, this is an emergency! Does anyone copy? I need help!"
Dialog_Misson405_101,I need help! Does anyone copy? Please respond!
Dialog_Misson405_102,"Hello, state your identity and location."
Dialog_Misson405_103,Hello! I am Paladin Danse of the Brotherhood of Steel! I'm surrounded by Super Mutants at the Cambridge College Square! Need assistance! Need assistance! Please... (signal lost)
Dialog_Misson405_104,The Cambridge College Square is one of the locations we planned to search for the Ex-Overseer. I believe we can send a Combat Team.
Dialog_Misson405_201,"I, Danse, thank you on behalf of the Brotherhood of Steel! Thank you for the rescue! The Brotherhood of Steel outpost at the Cambridge Police Station will be open to you. We welcome your presence!"
Dialog_Misson407_101,"Friends of the Vault, I have a proposition, you should establish a cooperative partnership with the Brotherhood of Steel."
Dialog_Misson407_102,"If you can support us with some firepower to eliminate the threats near the subway station, the Brotherhood would keep an eye out for the person you are searching for in the Commonwealth."
Dialog_Misson407_201,You have proven your good will and sincerity. The Brotherhood will keep our promise and you shall receive any news of your missing person first hand.
Dialog_Misson91049_101,Danse calling the Vault! We are headed west to search the Arcjet Systems for an investigation quest. We hope you can provide us with some support.
Dialog_Misson91049_102,"We helped you last time, but you didn't give us the information we need."
Dialog_Misson91049_103,"Don't worry, ma'am! We are men of our word! You know we are trustworthy."
Dialog_Misson91049_201,Thank you for the assistance! I have reported your contributions to Elder Maxon. He is grateful to you! He requested that I give you my full support.
Dialog_Misson91049_202,You need to keep your word...
Dialog_Misson410_101,Calling the Vault! Our scouting report showed that there is human activity near the C.I.T ruins. This could very well be your missing person.
Dialog_Misson410_102,You finally proved your worth.. We will be there soon.
Dialog_Misson414_101,What? You met some weirdo? He suggests we should ask a detective from Diamond City for help?
Dialog_Misson414_102,What is this detective's name? Nick Valentine? Is he reliable? Fine......looks like we don't have other better options.
Dialog_Misson414_103,Looks like we need to pick ourselves up and move the search towards Boston...
Dialog_Misson414_202,He seems to be investigating the correlation between radiation poisoning and mutations... Strange. Why is he in such a hurry to investigate this?
Dialog_Misson414_203,We have to keep searching for him and get to the bottom of this.
Dialog_Misson91102_101,"Finally, we're getting close to the Washington area. Diamond City is in this direction, as is that detective Nick Valentine."
Dialog_Misson91102_102,We don't know much about the path to Diamond City. It might be dangerous... Best to prepare the Combat Team. We must clear a path to Diamond City.
Dialog_Misson91107_101,Oh! Another Vault opened its door. Welcome to Diamond City! Is there anything I can help you with?
Dialog_Misson91107_102,"Hello, Mayor! We've come from a Vault."
Dialog_Misson91107_103,Oh! Another Vault opened its door. Welcome to Diamond City! Is there anything I could help you with?
Dialog_Misson91107_201,"Yes, Mayor, we're looking for a detective. His name is..."
Dialog_Misson91107_202,Hey! It's lunch time. Please come again in two hours. I need to eat my donuts and cheese pasta.
Dialog_Misson91107_203,What?!
Dialog_Misson91112_102,"Hello! Travelers of the Wasteland. You got nothing from the Mayor too, didn't you?"
Dialog_Misson91112_103,"Yeah! That's so annoying!...Wait, who are you?"
Dialog_Misson91112_104,"I'm Piper Wright, a reporter. I heard that you might be looking for Nick Valentine?"
Dialog_Misson91112_105,Yes! Yes! You know where he went?
Dialog_Misson91112_106,"I've been in contact with him. He's not in Diamond City right now, but he told me he's going to Police Precinct 8 for an investigation."
Dialog_Misson91112_107,"If you want to find Nick, go to Police Precinct 8."
Dialog_Misson91112_108,"Ok, great. Thanks for your help!"
Dialog_Misson91112_201,(Biography) It has been a while since I left the Institute. I think it's time for me to summarize what has been happening recently.
Dialog_Misson91112_202,"To tell the truth, I never thought this adventure on the surface would last this long......"
Dialog_Misson91112_203,"I still remember clearly how Clayton said to me ""It's ok Miss Filmore, it's only a 20 minute trip, you'll make it in time for afternoon tea."""
Dialog_Misson91112_204,"But then that idiot made a mistake with the coordinates, and sent me to the base of a group of Triggermen. The transmitter was broken too......"
Dialog_Misson91112_205,"Luckily some dwellers from a Vault rescued me, and kindly offered me shelter."
Dialog_Misson91112_206,"Although I can't trust these people completely, I can use this opportunity to conduct experiments on some mutants from the surface."
Dialog_Misson91112_207,"My experiment is simple, find some special mutants, record their activity, and then analyze it."
Dialog_Misson91112_208,Something strange happened toward the end of the experiment. We found a mysterious beacon on a Mirelurk.
Dialog_Misson91112_209,"From my experience, this doesn't look like human technology. Further testing upon our return to the Vault confirmed my speculation."
Dialog_Misson91112_210,"This beacon sends out a low frequency signal periodically, but when I tried to decode it, I discovered that this isn't like any known encryption method."
Dialog_Misson91112_211,"What's even weirder is when I was reviewing the data I collected before, I found similar signals hidden in the environmental data! What could this mean?"
Dialog_Misson91112_212,"Up until now, while I've been writing this experiment report, I've still felt the excitement of discovering something new......and the fear of the unknown."
Dialog_Misson91112_213,They're spying on us.
Dialog_Misson91112_214,"I can't solve this puzzle at the moment, but I believe the truth will unveil itself soon. This will be the Institute's—no—mankind's biggest discovery."
Dialog_Misson91117_101,"Thank you again for getting me out of that horrific place. Although I'm a Synth, I always repay kindness. Now let's hear about your case."
Dialog_Misson91117_102,"Great! Mr. Detective, so this is what happened......"
Dialog_Misson91117_103,"Interesting case, I think I can help you."
Dialog_Misson91117_104,"Before I leave, a source told me that an old man came to us asking for our best mechanic, Vera."
Dialog_Misson91117_105,"I later heard that Vera went to Mass Bay Medical Center with an old man. He didn't look very well, Vera probably wanted to help him find some medical supplies......"
Dialog_Misson91117_106,"So, Vault Dwellers, seems like you'll have to visit Mass Bay Medical Center."
Dialog_Misson91121_101,"Hello! According to the information you provided last time, I believe there is a good chance that he is headed towards the Boston Public Library."
Dialog_Misson91121_102,The contents in the library terminal are of interest to him... Hope you can find some clues there.
Dialog_Misson91121_201,"This Synth detective is not too shabby. The Overseer did leave a message, let me see what he has to say..."
Dialog_Misson91121_202,"""I understand my condition a lot better now. The Vault might run into trouble without the Resource Purifier. If only I can find tech to replace the it..."""
Dialog_Misson91121_203,"""Good thing the Vault Tech Headquarters is in East Boston. Not far now, hopefully I can find it there..."""
Dialog_Misson91121_204,"What does he mean by ""I understand my condition a lot better now""...? It doesn't make any sense! We have no choice, let's search the Vault Tech Headquarters."
Dialog_Misson91201_101,Our radio studio recently received a signal from an unidentified location. The signal is not clear. It sounds like something about liberation and freedom.
Dialog_Misson91201_102,Looks like we need to upgrade the radio station to learn more about distant locations.
Dialog_Misson91205_101,Good news! We pinpointed the location of Vault Tech Headquarters! Send the Combat Team now!
Dialog_Misson91205_102,"Hope we can also find something useful for our Vault... technology, equipment, resources, anything!"
Dialog_Misson91205_201,"Hello! I'm Glory, we've met before."
Dialog_Misson91205_202,"I've met many people, can't remember them all. You need to clarify."
Dialog_Misson91205_203,"Fine. Have you heard of the Railroad? I'm with them. If you want to work together, come talk to us at our headquarters."
Dialog_Misson91211_101,"To be honest, I trust you Vault Dwellers. My instincts are keen, you seem reliable. Desdemona did this for the safety of the Railroad."
Dialog_Misson91211_102,"We are, after all, in a dangerous business, we must be cautious. If you can help us to..."
Dialog_Misson91211_103,What?! We are working for that hag? I object!
Dialog_Misson91211_104,"No, ma'am, you will be working WITH the Railroad and our numerous agents, and we will repay you. Think about it..."
Dialog_Misson91211_105,"One day, I will make her work for me... I'll show her who's boss!"
Dialog_Misson91211_106,... Let's talk about our cooperation. The target for this quest is the Mass Fusion building.
Dialog_Misson91207_101,You said you are from a Vault? I've never heard of your Vault...
Dialog_Misson91207_102,Are you doubting us?!
Dialog_Misson91207_103,I'm allowed to be suspicious.
Dialog_Misson91207_104,"Hold your horses, don't get angry. We need to learn more about each other and build trust."
Dialog_Misson91215_101,Hello! I'm here because I'm in need of your help.
Dialog_Misson91215_102,"Lots of people need our instructions, you..."
Dialog_Misson91215_103,That's right. Don't forget that I'm a reporter. I have some ways of locating the person for you.
Dialog_Misson91215_104,Deal!
Dialog_Misson91215_105,Go to the Boston Bugle building and find some resources for me. I will work on finding the missing person for you.
Dialog_Misson91220_101,"You're in luck. Someone responded to the missing person report. The man's name is Rex, he said he met the person you are looking for."
Dialog_Misson91220_102,Wonderful! Where is he?
Dialog_Misson91220_103,He is in Trinity Tower. You'd better hurry. Trinity Tower is not a safe place.
Dialog_Misson91222_101,"Our situation is complicated, but we're not lost yet."
Dialog_Misson91222_102,"After knowing what Jacob went through, we can build a special tracking device to track his location."
Dialog_Misson91222_103,"First, we need a very precise tracking device. The Railroads are professionals when it comes to secret missions, so they should have something like this. I know you will think of something."
Dialog_Misson91222_104,"And since Jacob carries a Resource Purifier with him, we need a sample of a broken one. To my knowledge, the Brotherhood of Steel collects such things, you can try your luck there."
Dialog_Misson91222_105,"Lastly, for the most difficult thing, we need a pure FEV virus identification signal. High tech stuff like this can only be found in the Institute."
Dialog_Misson91222_106,"Given how old I am, my memory of the Institute is very vague, but I know one thing for certain: If you want to find the Institute, you'll have to let it find you first."
Dialog_Misson91222_107,"So, good luck!"
Dialog_Misson91222_108,Thank you! Mr. Detective!
Dialog_Misson91301_101,"Attention! The radio station received a weak signal, but it has a prominent pattern, it should be sending a message."
Dialog_Misson91301_102,We should upgrade the radio station and enhance the receiver to track the signal source.
Dialog_Misson91302_101,Done! We've found the signal source. It is coming from Charlestown.
Dialog_Misson91302_102,Our receiver will focus on this area and try to analyze the signal source for anything new.
Dialog_Misson91305_101,"Signal locked! It is coming from the Bureau of Alcohol, Drugs, Tobacco, Firearms and Lasers (BADTFL) pharmacy!"
Dialog_Misson91305_102,Is our Combat Team ready? They need to go to the BADTFL pharmacy and find out what's going on.
Dialog_Misson91306_101,Hello Vault Dwellers. We've been expecting you for a long time.
Dialog_Misson91306_102,You are...
Dialog_Misson91306_103,The Father has asked me to send you an invitation to the Institute.
Dialog_Misson91306_104,The Institute! You're from the Institute...
Dialog_Misson91306_105,"Come. Come to the Institute, let's talk there."
Dialog_Misson91306_106,What an annoying guy... but can we ignore the Institute?
Dialog_Misson91306_107,"We finally meet, friends from the Vault."
Dialog_Misson91306_108,"Hmph... If it were up to me, I wouldn't be here. Nothing good will come of this."
Dialog_Misson91306_109,Heh... setbacks are only momentary. You need to look into the future and understand the big picture.
Dialog_Misson91306_110,I have no idea what you're saying...
Dialog_Misson91306_111,"Look at the Brotherhood and the Railroad, they are too focused on the present gains and losses, and have no sight of the future."
Dialog_Misson91306_112,They are lost in their own perception. They have lost their inner desires. The Institute is building a new world. They are unable to comprehend.
Dialog_Misson91306_113,What's your point?
Dialog_Misson91306_114,You're unable to understand. That's okay. There is a price to pay for building the new world. I will help you understand.
Dialog_Misson91306_115,Let's... start by understanding the purpose of Synth technology.
Dialog_Misson91309_101,"Vault Dwellers, come, walk with me."
Dialog_Misson91309_102,Why? Where are you taking us?
Dialog_Misson91309_103,"Let me show you what the Institute has been working on, for the transition from the old to the new world."
Dialog_Misson91312_101,Heh... Long time no see. Looks like you're with the Institute...
Dialog_Misson91312_102,Huh? Where did you come from? Have we met?
Dialog_Misson91312_103,"You haven't met me. However, I was the one who gave you information about the old man at the Commonwealth Institute of Technology ruins."
Dialog_Misson91312_104,Huh...? Oh! You're the sneaky fellow!
Dialog_Misson91312_105,Ha ha ha! You're an interesting lady. I know you are desperate to find that old man. Look for me in Fort Hagen. I have more information for you.
Dialog_Misson91312_106,What... Hello...? Hello!! Don't leave me hanging!
Dialog_Misson91312_107,"Darn it! All mysterious and stuff... Fort Hagen... hmph! I know you have all given up on the Ex-Overseer, I'll go by myself!"
Dialog_Misson91312_108,The assistant is gone! We looked everywhere in the Vault! No signs of her!
Dialog_Misson91312_109,I looked at the radio station records. Her last conversation was with Kellogg. She must be going to Fort Hagen by herself!
Dialog_Misson91312_110,"This is absurd! Going to Fort Hagen by herself? Who does she think she is, Sarah Lyons? Let's go get her!"
Dialog_Misson91316_101,Hey! The assistant is finally out. A moment later and she would be at the bottom of the swamp.
Dialog_Misson91316_102,Sob... sob...
Dialog_Misson91316_103,Huh? You can cry...?
Dialog_Misson91316_104,Get lost! It's all because you guys don't want to look for the Ex-Overseer! Always mingling with the Railroad or the Institute!! Why am I even in this situation?
Dialog_Misson91316_105,"Oh... you've been mistaken. We are seriously looking for the Overseer, but this requires hard work from everyone. It cannot be accomplished alone."
Dialog_Misson91316_106,Sob... Hmph... whatever... I'm going to Fort Hagen to find Kellogg. He said he has information.
Dialog_Misson91316_107,"Sure thing, but we all move together. We wouldn't want to carry your corpse to find the Ex-Overseer."
Dialog_Misson91316_108,You...!! Get out of my sight!
Dialog_Misson91316_109,Okie dokie! Our assistant is back.
Dialog_Misson91317_101,Hi! We want......
Dialog_Misson91317_102,"You want a signal tracker, don't you?"
Dialog_Misson91317_103,How did you......
Dialog_Misson91317_104,"We have ears everywhere, and you haven't exactly been keeping a low profile. Enough chatting. You help us, we help you."
Dialog_Misson91317_105,Okay......
Dialog_Misson91317_106,Something unfortunate happened a while ago. A bunch of Synths we rescued lost control and became Raiders.
Dialog_Misson91317_107,"This is very sensitive, we have lost many good agents because of this. I hope you can....put these uncontrollable Synths to rest."
Dialog_Misson91317_108,"You have to be careful and lay low. I will let Deacon help you, he will tell you what to do."
Dialog_Misson91317_201,"Good, you're back. I heard the mission had a small... problem, good to see that you're all safe."
Dialog_Misson91317_202,I had Tom prepare the signal tracker you needed. Hope you'll like it.
Dialog_Misson91317_203,"You have to remember to put it down softly, it's very delicate. I can't promise it'll work if it gets scratched."
Dialog_Misson91317_204,"Okay Tom, stop scaring our guests."
Dialog_Misson91317_205,"Goodbye, friends from the Vault. I have a feeling we will meet again."
Dialog_Misson91401_101,"<playername>, Kellogg said he has news for you. He annoys me, you go talk to him."
Dialog_Misson91401_102,"Heh... looks like someone is avoiding me. But this time, I really have the information you want..."
Dialog_Misson91401_103,"According to my intel, the old man you are looking for is heading north from Charlestown, which means he is going to Revere."
Dialog_Misson91401_104,"Well, you have the intel. It's up to you whether you find him or not."
Dialog_Misson91408_101,Hi! How are you! Still recognize me?
Dialog_Misson91408_102,Deacon? What... do you want?
Dialog_Misson91408_103,"Hah! Glad you still remember me, I thought you would have forgotten me."
Dialog_Misson91408_104,Speak... what do you want?
Dialog_Misson91408_105,"Hmm, I like your blunt approach. Yes, I'm here to tell you that I know where the person you are looking for went."
Dialog_Misson91408_106,What? Where is he?
Dialog_Misson91408_107,"Heh, I said he went there, the Guard Training Yard. My agents saw him there, as for now..."
Dialog_Misson91408_108,"Alright! We got it! Thanks for the information, we will go right away."
Dialog_Misson91408_109,Ha ha... so hasty...
Dialog_Misson91408_110,What? Let me see! Hurry!
Dialog_Misson91408_111,This is it...! This must've been left behind by the Ex-Overseer! The markings on the map are identical to the places from the intel!
Dialog_Misson91408_112,The Guard Training Yard is also marked... next is... Inner Bay! He circled it!
Dialog_Misson91408_113,The Pride Industries Shipyard and Taffington Boathouse at Inner Bay are both marked! This means he went to both places!
Dialog_Misson91408_114,"No more markings after these! If we can't find him at these two locations, then..."
Dialog_Misson91408_115,"We must hurry! This is the closest we have been all this time! Hurry! Let's move, Combat Team!"
Dialog_Misson91412_101,"Is the Combat Team ready? Search the first target, Industries Shipyard! Move!"
Dialog_Misson91412_102,I hope...
Dialog_Misson91412_103,What?! Nothing...! Calm down! Calm down! Then maybe the Taffington Boathouse.
Dialog_Misson91412_104,Have the Combat Team regroup and get ready for the next location!
Dialog_Misson91413_101,........
Dialog_Misson91413_102,She's not doing well... hey! Hang in there!
Dialog_Misson91413_103,It's over... we lost his trail again...
Dialog_Misson91413_104,"Don't think like that, look at the map, even though there are no new markings, his path is easily predictable. Looks like he continued north..."
Dialog_Misson91413_105,Hmm...? You mean?
Dialog_Misson91413_106,"From the marked locations, he seems to be searching for something with a purpose, gradually heading north. I think his next step is..."
Dialog_Misson91413_107,Malden!
Dialog_Misson91416_101,"According to our preliminary info on Malden, the Central Subway Station is a major traffic route. If the Ex-Overseer went to Malden..."
Dialog_Misson91416_102,"He must have gone through the Central Subway Station, right?"
Dialog_Misson91416_103,"Yes, I think so."
Dialog_Misson91416_104,"Good. We don't have any other leads, let's begin with the Central Subway Station."
Dialog_Misson91417_101,"Vault Dwellers, how can I help you?"
Dialog_Misson91417_102,We want to......borrow a broken Resource Purifier. Just for a few days......
Dialog_Misson91417_103,"(Kells thought about it, stroking his beard)"
Dialog_Misson91417_104,No. The Brotherhood's recorded technology will be documented. No one can access it except for Elder Maxson.
Dialog_Misson91417_105,But you can join our latest scouting team. Their new mission is to recover Vault 75's lost technology.
Dialog_Misson91417_106,"If you happen to find a broken Resource Purifier, I can allow the recover mission to be 'delayed for a few days.'"
Dialog_Misson91417_107,"This looks like our only chance. Thank you, 'chief.'"
Dialog_Misson91417_108,It's 'captain' to you. Now let's go find Scribe Haylen. She's the leader of this mission.
Dialog_Misson91501_101,"<playername>, the Radio Studio just received a new signal! You need to know about it."
Dialog_Misson91501_102,"The signal this time is a little weak, and the Radio Studio needs to have some technological upgrades in order to better analyze its source."
Dialog_Misson91501_103,Do you think whether it has anything to do with the ex-Overseer or not?
Dialog_Misson91502_101,"The Radio Studio has been upgraded, and the analysis of the signal has been finished. But, the signal this time is a bit troublesome."
Dialog_Misson91502_102,"The signal is too weak to locate accurately, so we suspect it may come from the northern suburbs of the Commonwealth. The wetlands in the middle part or somewhere in Parsons."
Dialog_Misson91502_103,So we don't have good idea now. We can only collect the basic information first and let's start from the northern suburbs of the Commonwealth.
Dialog_Misson91505_101,The situation in the northern part of the Commonwealth is not complicated. The General Atomics Galleria should be our main target.
Dialog_Misson91505_102,"Actually, I think we might as well throw some dice to see if it's worth the trip. We're taking a big risk."
Dialog_Misson91505_103,"Who said that? There was once a time that we have absolutely no clues, but we didn't stop searching!"
Dialog_Misson91505_104,"I don't know what happened to the signal, but the ex-Overseer's previous route to the north is very clear."
Dialog_Misson91505_105,Just do as I ask! Otherwise I will go there myself!
Dialog_Misson91505_106,"Oh, I'm convinced... Let's go. Let's go."
Dialog_Misson91509_101,"I have been thinking about it for a long time, and I think there is something wrong! Don't you think the signal this time came too suddenly?"
Dialog_Misson91509_102,It looks like someone deliberately let us find things and look for them. I feel so weird! I'm sure it's not normal.
Dialog_Misson91509_103,Weird? Ho ho ho... Or you can give me some clues that aren't so weird
Dialog_Misson91509_104,Well...
Dialog_Misson91509_105,"What do you think? To follow the current clues, or to find more reliable clues now Which one do you choose?"
Dialog_Misson91509_106,So we have no choice but to keep going.
Dialog_Misson91513_101,"Alas, looking for this weak signal seems...indeed a bit difficult. What Sturges said is right. It's like taking a chance."
Dialog_Misson91513_102,But we don't have a better way. I hope you won't blame me...
Dialog_Misson91513_103,What! You found it?! The ex-Overseer's watch! Let me see!
Dialog_Misson91513_104,...It's real! It is indeed his watch! But this...this is really weird!
Dialog_Misson91513_105,It's certainly weird. Even you find it so weird.
Dialog_Misson91513_106,"Don't think I can understand what you mean, but I won't argue with you Before we make it clear."
Dialog_Misson91514_101,Come on. Now we can have a good talk about what to do next.
Dialog_Misson91514_102,"OK, you start first. I want to listen to your idea."
Dialog_Misson91514_103,"Hey! If you ask me, need I say anything?"
Dialog_Misson91514_104,"...Well, I know your idea and you needn't say that."
Dialog_Misson91514_105,I doubt that the ex-Overseer may be facing some dangers now.
Dialog_Misson91514_106,"Ah, after listening to your words, I also have an idea to say."
Dialog_Misson91514_107,"Shut up! Let's prepare for the worst, and let the Combat Team search around the area to see if there are any further clues."
Dialog_Misson91518_101,Hello to you all.
Dialog_Misson91518_102,(Shocked) Kellogg
Dialog_Misson91518_103,It's Kellogg.
Dialog_Misson91518_104,(Shocked) Kellogg!
Dialog_Misson91518_105,"We meet again my friends, you seem to be doing fine lately."
Dialog_Misson91518_106,This is none of your business. What is a bounty hunter like you doing here?
Dialog_Misson91518_107,"I'm representing the Institute to offer you a proposal. The Institute know that you need an identification signal for FEV, but these are very hard to find."
Dialog_Misson91518_108,"The Institute thinks that you can provide some 'data' as an exchange. Fair, isn't it?"
Dialog_Misson91518_109,What data do you want?
Dialog_Misson91518_110,......you'll see once we get there. Just take it as a small challenge the Institute has provided for you. You'll enjoy it.
Dialog_Misson91518_111,"Brilliant, we have all the parts. I have asked Nick to come......oh, Nick's here."
Dialog_Misson91518_112,"Oh, you finally have everything. My old Synthetic heart was starting to worry."
Dialog_Misson91518_113,"I'm relieved to see you've still got your humor, but let's get back to business. These are the parts you need."
Dialog_Misson91518_114,"Thanks for the trouble. Now, I need some time assembling these into a tracker. I will find you once I have finished."
Dialog_Misson91518_115,Then we will wait for your good news. Hope you won't keep us waiting too long.
Dialog_Misson91714_101,Nick's here! He said he finally finished the tracker! How long I've waited......
Dialog_Misson91714_102,Here I am. You must have been waiting for a long time. This little gadget took me a long time. That was because one of the......
Dialog_Misson91714_103,"I don't want to hear about that, just tell us how to use it."
Dialog_Misson91714_104,"Ok, turn here, done. Let's see if there are any signals."
Dialog_Misson91714_105,"Yes, there's a signal at the...um...this beam is pointing towards South Boston Military Checkpoint ."
Dialog_Misson91714_106,What is he doing in the south?
Dialog_Misson91714_107,"You should ask him, and you need to leave very soon. Hopefully you can find him this time."
Dialog_Misson91715_101,"The old Overseer went to the Glowing Sea! What do we do now......Nick, do you have any good ideas?"
Dialog_Misson91715_102,The best thing we should do now would probably be...to send out a signal to ask for help from those people we've come across.
Dialog_Misson91715_103,This is your best idea?
Dialog_Misson91715_104,Worth a try.
Dialog_Misson91715_105,"Fine, let's do it."
Dialog_Misson91715_106,"(Broadcasting) This is the Vault. My friends, we need your help. We need to cross the Glowing Sea urgently. If you could be of help, we would be very grateful! I repeat......"
Dialog_Misson91715_107,"Hey! No need to repeat, I'm here."
Dialog_Misson91715_108,It's you! Kellogg!
Dialog_Misson91715_109,......Are you still making this joke? Don't you get bored?
Dialog_Misson91715_110,I never thought you'd be the first person to come.
Dialog_Misson91715_111,Well...remember how we worked together before? The Institute thinks we can collaborate again after the last 'test.'
Dialog_Misson91715_112,We're listening.
Dialog_Misson91715_113,Sounds like you need a way to cross the Glowing Sea; and it happens that I need to cross it too......to deal with someone called Virgil.
Dialog_Misson91715_114,"Hey, listen, we don't want to be associated with bounty hunters like you......"
Dialog_Misson91715_115,We'd like to collaborate.
Dialog_Misson91715_116,What? How could you......
Dialog_Misson91715_117,"Listen to me, and repeat; we would like to collaborate."
Dialog_Misson91715_118,"Great, this is what a smart person would say. Meet me at General Atomics Factory. I will then tell you about our next plan. So, till we meet again."
Dialog_Misson91715_119,"I thought the leaden nuclear winter would let us down forever, but we would ride the lightning across a sea that is burning."
Dialog_Misson91715_120,Nick......I'm completely lost now......
Dialog_Misson91715_121,"Listen, I have a brilliant idea. It's so brilliant that if you add a tail to this idea, it would turn into a fox."
Dialog_Misson91715_122,I still don't get it. It's obvious that Kellogg is going to kill Virgil and Virgil is obviously the person we need to find. Then why are we helping him?
Dialog_Misson91715_123,Haha. You'll know when the time comes. Tell your group to depart for General Atomics Factory.
Dialog_Misson91715_124,What the heck......
Dialog_Misson20217_101,So good to hear that Boston Airport has been cleaned up.
Dialog_Misson20217_102,Hm? Does that place mean something special to you?
Dialog_Misson20217_103,"Yes, m'am! Now that there's Boston Airport, the Brotherhood can travel from Washington to Boston by air."
Dialog_Misson20217_104,Oh.
Dialog_Misson20217_105,I need to report the good news to headquarters. Please wait.
Dialog_Misson20217_106,Oh. This doesn't really have anything to do with me......
Dialog_Misson20217_107,Elder Maxson? This is Paladin Danse! I've got good news for you!
Dialog_Misson20217_108,"Paladin Danse, this is Maxson. Tell me this good news."
Dialog_Misson20217_109,The vanguards cleaned up Boston Airport with the help of our friends from the Vault.
Dialog_Misson20217_110,"We can land Prydwen here, and send our military forces."
Dialog_Misson20217_111,"This really is a good news, Danse. Thank those Vault Dwellers for me, hopefully we can meet them once we reach Boston."
Dialog_Misson20217_112,"I don't think that would be a problem, Elder Maxson."
Dialog_Misson20217_113,"Ok Danse, hold your position and enjoy your accomplishment, we will meet soon enough."
Dialog_Misson20217_114,"Yes, Elder Maxson, wish you the very best!"
Dialog_Misson20217_115,"You too, Danse."
Dialog_Misson20217_116,"(Ends communication) See, Elder Maxson has a very good impression of you."
Dialog_Misson20217_117,I couldn't tell.
Dialog_Misson20217_118,"Don't worry, ma'am. The Brotherhood is very sincere and warm towards real friends."
Dialog_Relation_001001,"As the commander of the Minutemen, can you describe the Minutemen policies to the readers of Publik Occurrences?"
Dialog_Relation_001002,I will leave the answer for our General.
Dialog_Relation_001003,The Minutemen patrol is well-known in the Commonwealth. Many readers of the Public Occurrences want to sign up. What are your prerequisites to sign up?
Dialog_Relation_001004,"Give them a laser musket. If they can load the fusion cells properly, we'll take them."
Dialog_Relation_001005,"As a prewar robotic medic, do you have anything to say to the readers of Public Occurrences?"
Dialog_Relation_001006,Sometimes I miss the days when I didn't have a nose. I hope people can shower daily.
Dialog_Relation_001007,I think Public Occurrences should start a hygiene and medical column. Teach everyone on the Wasteland how to remain clean and healthy. I can write the articles.
Dialog_Relation_001008,"Umm, Madam Curie, you have no idea who our readers are, right?"
Dialog_Relation_001009,"Mr. Danse, where does the Brotherhood of Steel's hatred towards the Synths come from?"
Dialog_Relation_001010,"We don't just hate the Synths, we also hate all mutants."
Dialog_Relation_001011,"Mr. Danse, can you introduce the Brotherhood of Steel to the readers of Public Occurrences?"
Dialog_Relation_001012,We welcome anyone who can kill a Deathclaw barehanded to join us.
Dialog_Relation_001013,"Nick, if you have any tips, you must let us have the exclusive."
Dialog_Relation_001014,"Sure thing, nothing can escape the eyes of Piper, our great reporter."
Dialog_Relation_001015,Do you remember the events when you were born? I mean back in the Institute.
Dialog_Relation_001016,Our second generation prototypes have limited memory capacity. I'm afraid that data is lost forever.
Dialog_Relation_001017,Most readers of Public Occurrences are fans of yours. Can you tell us how you became a celebrity in Goodneighbor?
Dialog_Relation_001018,"Sorry babe, you need higher charisma to get to know me better."
Dialog_Relation_001019,"Mr Deacon, as an agent that lives on the edge, do you have any exciting stories you can share with the readers of Public Occurrences?"
Dialog_Relation_001020,I once changed my face and pretended to be a woman for a few months. You should have seen the look on their faces when they found out.
Dialog_Relation_001021,Don't trust anyone!
Dialog_Relation_001022,"Oh, cut the crap... you really thought I'm a Synth?"
Dialog_Relation_001023,"Mr Jack, you must let us create a special report about you and your family."
Dialog_Relation_001024,"Some things are better off buried forever, madam, just like the mask my father found."
Dialog_Relation_001025,I heard you were a part of the water purification project in Capital Wasteland?
Dialog_Relation_001026,The water purification project turned Capital Wasteland into a habitable place. The things I'm currently doing in the Institute are for the same purpose.
Dialog_Relation_001027,Can you describe Little Lamplight to the readers of Public Occurrences?
Dialog_Relation_001028,That's the worst orphanage in the world. Children can be much crueler than adults.
Dialog_Relation_001029,"You were a part of the Gunners, what made you leave the faction?"
Dialog_Relation_001030,"As the largest gang in the Commonwealth, they were too stingy on the commissions."
Dialog_Relation_001031,"Even though you don't remember anything, you will join us again sooner or later."
Dialog_Relation_001032,"No matter what you say, nothing can sway the faith of a Brotherhood of Steel ."
Dialog_Relation_001033,"Mr Danse, examination of your body revealed some strange data."
Dialog_Relation_001034,"Nothing to worry about. Warriors of the Brotherhood are all extremely well trained, of course we are different from normal folk."
Dialog_Relation_001035,"Dude, you're a Synth..."
Dialog_Relation_001036,"Miss, you seem to be cold towards the settlers of Goodneighbor. You're not infected by the idiots of Diamond City, are you?"
Dialog_Relation_001037,You town is quite memorable. I've just been busy lately. Maybe I will do an exclusive on you sometime.
Dialog_Force_20103_101,"So glad that you're here! We intercepted a signal from a settlement not long ago, it said that Raiders kidnapped one of their townsfolk."
Dialog_Force_20103_102,"According to our intel, these Raiders call themselves the 'Head Smashers.' They specialize in kidnapping and their methods are very cruel. We should rescue him immediately."
Dialog_Force_20103_103,"Don't worry, Preston, it's us they're going against, their good days are over."
Dialog_Force_20103_104,Let's do this!
Dialog_Force_20103_105,Surrender! Lay down your weapons! Let the hostage go and maybe we will consider letting you live!
Dialog_Force_20103_106,"Hahaha! Hilarious! I know who you are, Minutemen leftovers. What makes you think you can fight the Head Smashers?"
Dialog_Force_20103_107,That's right! I heard from the radio that they're still advertising 'find the Minutemen when in trouble and build a better Concord......' so ridiculous! Hahaha!
Dialog_Force_20103_108,"Ha! It's just a bunch of nobodies wanting to rescue someone. I'm game! Come at me, if you dare!"
Dialog_Force_20103_109,"Ok, that makes everything easier. I was worried that you might beg for mercy, I'd have a hard time deciding whether or not to let you go."
Dialog_Force_20103_110,Bah! Get them! Smash these scumbags' heads! Let them know who the Head Smashers really are!
Dialog_Force_20103_111,"Though we are what's left of the Minutemen, you're still no match for us."
Dialog_Force_20103_112,You......you......
Dialog_Force_20103_113,"Are you ok? Don't worry, we took care of the Raiders, you're safe."
Dialog_Force_20103_114,Why couldn't you come sooner? I...you...you're the worst! Do you know how vile these Raiders have been?
Dialog_Force_20103_115,Uh......
Dialog_Force_20103_116,Worst rescue ever!
Dialog_Force_20103_117,Geez! What the heck! We shouldn't have rescued him.
Dialog_Force_20103_118,"It's not our job to be choosey. We rescue everyone, even if they are ungrateful."
Dialog_Force_20103_119,But is someone like him really worth it?
Dialog_Force_20103_120,Hmm...the outcome does not matter. I believe the Minutemen will get what we deserve in due time.
Dialog_Force_20106_101,"Ronnie, how is it?"
Dialog_Force_20106_102,"Brilliant, this place has the best display of mutant creatures in the whole Wasteland."
Dialog_Force_20106_103,"That means we will be busy, thank you for your help."
Dialog_Force_20106_104,"No worries, we're old friends, this is nothing."
Dialog_Force_20106_105,Then let's get rid of these monsters as soon as possible. Rebuilding the Minutemen will require a lot of work.
Dialog_Force_20106_106,"Preston, it must be hard re-establishing the Minutemen."
Dialog_Force_20106_107,"Yes, there are only a few of us left and what's left are struggling to survive. Rebuilding is very difficult."
Dialog_Force_20106_108,"I have some plans though. For instance, we should make a stable basecamp at the Museum of Freedom, so that everyone has a place to rest. Then we can slowly expand."
Dialog_Force_20106_109,"Ahhhh, so cleaning up these monsters is the first step?"
Dialog_Force_20106_110,"That's right! I need everyone to believe that our camp is safe, that the Minutemen are strong enough to protect ourselves and others."
Dialog_Force_20106_111,Wow......I think I know what you mean.
Dialog_Force_20106_112,"Mmhm. See that monster ahead? Come, let us show you our powers."
Dialog_Force_20106_113,"Ha, this is our strong suit."
Dialog_Force_20106_114,"If we record a fight on a Holotape and advertise it with the radio in Concord, maybe it will encourage the settlers to join the Minutemen?"
Dialog_Force_20106_115,"I don't doubt it, my friend. You were brilliant, I think you should have the title Minutemen Colonel."
Dialog_Force_20106_116,Oh? Sounds cool!
Dialog_Force_20106_117,"Of course, as a Colonel, you will be in the most dangerous situations, solve the most difficult problems, and......"
Dialog_Force_20106_118,"Wait a minute...too much responsibility, let me think about it......"
Dialog_Force_20106_119,Hahaha!
Dialog_Force_20106_120,Did I miss something interesting?
Dialog_Force_20106_121,"Uh huh, I was thinking, for the good of the Minutemen, we need a reliable Colonel, an idol for the people."
Dialog_Force_20106_122,Wait! I still need to think about it!
Dialog_Force_20106_123,Oh? I think that's a great idea! I know where we can find enough monsters to make this Colonel official!
Dialog_Force_20106_124,"Let me stop you right there, let's keep cleaning up these monsters here, come on......"
Dialog_Force_20107_101,"Glad to work with you, Preston."
Dialog_Force_20107_102,"I'm very grateful for you help. It's not a difficult task this time, all we need to do is collect some nearby resources."
Dialog_Force_20107_103,Will it be used to build a settlement?
Dialog_Force_20107_104,"Yes. The Minutemen have been helping the people with their troubles, but the biggest problem was not having hope or direction."
Dialog_Force_20107_105,Will building settlements bring them hope?
Dialog_Force_20107_106,"Yes, it will. Who doesn't want a more stable life on the Wasteland? The Minutemen can be the first one to achieve this."
Dialog_Force_20107_107,That sounds very nice......wait! There's someone ahead!
Dialog_Force_20107_108,Let's go check it out.
Dialog_Force_20107_109,"Stop! Thieves! Trying to steal our things, huh?"
Dialog_Force_20107_110,Uh......you sound so confident that I'm starting to doubt myself.
Dialog_Force_20107_111,There is nothing to say to a bunch of thieves! Get them! And get their things!
Dialog_Force_20107_112,"Oh great, we're not thieves but they're definitely Raiders."
Dialog_Force_20107_113,Even his logic is very 'Raider-y'
Dialog_Force_20107_114,"Woah, these Raiders stole a lot......"
Dialog_Force_20107_115,"I hope there are more Raiders like this, it would save me a lot of time and energy."
Dialog_Force_20107_116,Hahaha......Preston has humor.
Dialog_Force_20110_101,"This is it! According to Ronnie's intel, the lead we got on the lost settler indicates this is the spot."
Dialog_Force_20110_102,To find a place like this......I really want to know how Ronnie did it.
Dialog_Force_20110_103,"You can ask Ronnie if you really want to know, I think she will teach you, but you have to be tough as nails."
Dialog_Force_20110_104,Uh...I'll travel with you instead.
Dialog_Force_20110_105,Look! Someone's ahead!
Dialog_Force_20110_106,"Raiders! This isn't good, that lost settler......"
Dialog_Force_20110_107,Follow me!
Dialog_Force_20110_108,Boss! There are more people coming!
Dialog_Force_20110_109,"Oh? Today's a good day! Even I'm embarrassed by how poor that drunk was. Nothing to loot, these people on the other hand...."
Dialog_Force_20110_110,B......boss......it doesn't look like an easy job......
Dialog_Force_20110_111,Nonsense! We're not easy either! Why are you afraid of them!
Dialog_Force_20110_112,Uh...boss...this isn't a good idea......
Dialog_Force_20110_113,"Exactly, we don't have to fight. We are only here looking for the...drunk you were talking about."
Dialog_Force_20110_114,"That drunk? We saw him lying there so we searched him for anything valuable, but we couldn't find anything, then he woke up and left!"
Dialog_Force_20110_115,"......Ah, ok. You shouldn't be wandering the Wasteland, isn't a normal life better?"
Dialog_Force_20110_116,Huh? ...ah...this...
Dialog_Force_20110_117,Think about it. I hope to see you become a settler that can actually do something good for the Wasteland. Anyway we're out of here.
Dialog_Force_20110_118,Bye.
Dialog_Force_20110_119,And......
Dialog_Force_20110_120,This is a good opportunity! Do it now!
Dialog_Force_20110_121,Huhh??
Dialog_Force_20110_122,Uh...it really wasn't worth it...
Dialog_Force_20110_123,This is just a group of people who have lost direction and hope. We really need to make the people have hope again......
Dialog_Force_20110_124,"The Minutemen can do it, right?"
Dialog_Force_20110_125,"Yes, we can."
Dialog_Force_20111_101,"Hello, Vault Dwellers."
Dialog_Force_20111_102,"Hi! Preston, how is the building of the settlement going? Everything going smoothly?"
Dialog_Force_20111_103,"Apart from the lack of some resources, everything is going pretty well. We had influence on some settlers and they have come to help us with the construction."
Dialog_Force_20111_104,Sounds amazing!
Dialog_Force_20111_105,"Yes. As long as we try a little harder and ensure the constant supply of provisions, then I believe more settlers will join us."
Dialog_Force_20111_106,"No time to waste, let's get to it!"
Dialog_Force_20111_107,"We did well this time, with these provisions, the settlement should have some basic functions returned."
Dialog_Force_20111_108,"If the settlers have faith in the Minutemen, then they will surely want to join the Minutemen. When that time comes, the Minutemen will be reborn again."
Dialog_Force_20111_109,"Wow! Preston, you're really a leader now, I have confidence in you."
Dialog_Force_20111_110,"Haha...actually, we now have the title of colonel."
Dialog_Force_20111_111,I trust that you can find the best person for this position! Good luck Preston! We need to go back to the Vault.
Dialog_Force_20111_112,Haha......
Dialog_Force_20203_101,Hello! Vault Dwellers.
Dialog_Force_20203_102,Hi Haylen! So happy to see you! Are you joining this mission?
Dialog_Force_20203_103,Haha Naaww......Danse is waiting for you.
Dialog_Force_20203_104,Aw......what a pity......
Dialog_Force_20203_105,"Don't be down, there will be plenty of opportunities later."
Dialog_Force_20203_106,"Ok. We'll be on our way then, take care, Haylen."
Dialog_Force_20203_107,Don't worry! I'm strong.
Dialog_Force_20203_108,Danse! We're coming!
Dialog_Force_20203_109,"Great to see you guys! With your help, this mission will definitely run smoothly."
Dialog_Force_20203_110,Then please briefly explain the situation. Briefly......
Dialog_Force_20203_111,"Ok. The last time we went to the Federal supply cache 84NE to investigate, we ran into a lot of Synths, we were outnumbered, so we had to retreat."
Dialog_Force_20203_112,"With your help, it shouldn't be a problem this time."
Dialog_Force_20203_113,You mean you've been here before? What were you investigating?
Dialog_Force_20203_114,"The large population of Synths in the Boston area was beyond our imagination. Some Synths were acting under special instructions, so we...well, we have top secret missions."
Dialog_Force_20203_115,"Ok, I've asked too many questions, my bad. Tell us what we need to do."
Dialog_Force_20203_116,"Thanks for your understanding. Please help us get rid of these Synths, I will be collecting some necessary data."
Dialog_Force_20203_117,That's it?
Dialog_Force_20203_118,"Yes, that's it."
Dialog_Force_20203_119,Easy peasy. It's on like Donkey Kong!
Dialog_Force_20203_120,"This is good enough, I have the data I need. Haylen will take a look at this data."
Dialog_Force_20203_121,"Oh, that's it then, we will be heading back to the Vault."
Dialog_Force_20203_122,"Thank you for your assistance! If you need anything, Haylen and I will try our best to help you."
Dialog_Force_20204_101,"Paladin Danse from the Brotherhood of Steel, here. I send to you my respects, Vault Dwellers!"
Dialog_Force_20204_102,"You don't have to act like that, Danse. All formal."
Dialog_Force_20204_103,It's a Paladin's natural state. It's like breathing air for them.
Dialog_Force_20204_104,"This is a fine habit. Speaking of formalities, you should formally introduce yourself, Haylen."
Dialog_Force_20204_105,"Okay. Danse has already done it, hasn't he?"
Dialog_Force_20204_106,Yes...haha...what will we be doing?
Dialog_Force_20204_107,"Simple, our main mission is to clear out Kendall Hospital and search for useful provisions, especially medical goods."
Dialog_Force_20204_108,"Our outpost has been depleted with our recent fights. We are in dire need of supplies, otherwise the outpost will not last long."
Dialog_Force_20204_109,"Understood, then let us help."
Dialog_Force_20204_110,"Thank you very much! Haylen, wait for us outside. Be careful."
Dialog_Force_20204_111,"Ok, Danse."
Dialog_Force_20204_112,We have collected quite a lot of provisions......Is everything alright with you?
Dialog_Force_20204_113,I feel like I'm just getting warmed up.
Dialog_Force_20204_114,Good! You're all experienced fighters!
Dialog_Force_20204_115,There are a lot of mutant monsters here. But it doesn't matter. Our Brotherhood will rid this place of mutants one day. After that everything will be back to normal.
Dialog_Force_20204_116,"Haha, that's not difficult at all. I think the Dwellers from my Vault are enough for these monsters."
Dialog_Force_20204_117,"Maybe I didn't express myself clearly. I meant the entire Boston area. Not trying to brag, but I alone would be enough to clean up a place like this, but I appreciate the back up."
Dialog_Force_20204_118,"Wow, ok Paladin. All the monsters in Boston...that sounds like bragging to me."
Dialog_Force_20204_119,"You wouldn't doubt us if you knew the strength of the Brotherhood of Steel. Our duty is to rid this world of all mutants, and...human beings that create mutants."
Dialog_Force_20204_120,People that create mutants? What does that even mean?
Dialog_Force_20204_121,"Sorry, I can't tell you now. This is related to my top mission."
Dialog_Force_20204_122,"Ok, but removing all mutants in Boston......could the Brotherhood really do that?"
Dialog_Force_20204_123,Without a doubt!
Dialog_Force_20204_124,"Then we cannot wait until that day comes, Paladin."
Dialog_Force_20204_125,"It will be here, just gotta be patient."
Dialog_Force_20208_101,"This is Polymer Labs, Paladin Danse and his team are probably trapped somewhere inside. Let's go find them."
Dialog_Force_20208_102,Got it. Be careful everyone!
Dialog_Force_20208_103,"Found them! Danse, how are you doing?"
Dialog_Force_20208_104,So happy to see you. We are quite alright. Getting out of here shouldn't be a problem. But Haylen has a task to finish.
Dialog_Force_20208_105,"Hi! Vault Dwellers, so glad you came to help."
Dialog_Force_20208_106,"Oh, Haylen, didn't think the opportunity you said before came so soon."
Dialog_Force_20208_107,Are you happy then?
Dialog_Force_20208_108,I am honored!
Dialog_Force_20208_109,"Hmm, I think you are talking about something I don't know......"
Dialog_Force_20208_110,"Yes, I had an agreement with this friend from the Vault."
Dialog_Force_20208_111,"So, Danse, leave the rest to us. We will help Haylen finish her task."
Dialog_Force_20208_112,"Ok, that's very reassuring."
Dialog_Force_20208_113,"Haylen, what's your task?"
Dialog_Force_20208_114,I need to do a search in Polymer Labs and see if I can find any old technology. But those green guys aren't as friendly as you.
Dialog_Force_20208_115,"Oh, don't worry, Haylen. Leave the green guys to us. We will teach them how to be friendly."
Dialog_Force_20208_116,Haha......
Dialog_Force_20208_117,"Wait, there's a device. If luck is on my side......"
Dialog_Force_20208_118,"Hmm......this data is quite different from the ones I've known. Though it won't be of great help, but this difference can probably help me analyze something......"
Dialog_Force_20208_119,That means......
Dialog_Force_20208_120,Thanks to you I found something useful!
Dialog_Force_20208_121,Good! At least it wasn't for nothing.
Dialog_Force_20208_122,Yes. Thank you again. Hope you can come and visit our outpost more often!
Dialog_Force_20208_123,"Haha! Don't worry, Haylen. We will."
Dialog_Force_20202_101,"You're here, Vault Dwellers! Listen, I have a very important mission that will require your cooperation."
Dialog_Force_20202_102,"No problem, Danse. I promise you'll get all the help you need."
Dialog_Force_20202_103,Glad to hear you say that. Shame I can't tell you about the details......
Dialog_Force_20202_104,"That's ok, Danse. We're happy to help out a friend."
Dialog_Force_20202_105,"I'm very lucky to have you as friends. Please believe me when I say that the Brotherhood will always be your trusted, reliable and loyal friend."
Dialog_Force_20202_106,Caution! Raiders!
Dialog_Force_20202_107,Hey! Look at those idiots! Hand out your weapons! Hand...ou...out...weapons?
Dialog_Force_20202_108,"Oh, look, a real idiot!"
Dialog_Force_20202_109,"Oh great, I was worried that these Raiders will mess up my mission. Looks like I worried too early."
Dialog_Force_20202_110,"Will the Raiders interrupt your mission, Danse?"
Dialog_Force_20202_111,"They still may. I need to set up a hidden device. Whether it's useful to them or not, the Raiders will destroy it if they see it."
Dialog_Force_20202_112,We'll get rid of those Raiders. This will solve the problem right?
Dialog_Force_20202_113,It's the best way.
Dialog_Force_20202_114,"But...Danse, I think you just told us your secret mission."
Dialog_Force_20202_115,"Oh, right. I don't think this is important anymore. You are my trusted friends, aren't you?"
Dialog_Force_20202_116,Haha! Danse finally came through.
Dialog_Force_20202_117,"As a Paladin of the Brotherhood of Steel, I have my rules. But I'm not made of stone."
Dialog_Force_20202_118,"This is it, I need to set up the device here. Please keep a lookout."
Dialog_Force_20202_119,"Just focus on your work, leave the rest to us."
Dialog_Force_20202_120,Done! I made sure to disguise it to make it seem like nothing has changed here. The Raiders will not notice it.
Dialog_Force_20202_121,"Great! Mission accomplished, let's get out of here."
Dialog_Force_20202_122,"Thank you for your help! I, Paladin Danse, send you the highest regards on behalf of the Brotherhood of Steel."
Dialog_Force_20202_123,Ok......Danse is still that Paladin from the Brotherhood of Steel.
Dialog_Force_20202_124,Ahh!
Dialog_Force_20202_125,Woah! Got me good......what are two ladies doing here?
Dialog_Force_20202_126,"Don't be afraid ladies, I'm Paladin Danse of the Brotherhood of Steel. These Vault Dwellers and I are on a mission. You're safe with us."
Dialog_Force_20202_127,"Really, that's fantastic. I'm Irma from Goodneighbor. This is the very famous singer Magnolia from the same place."
Dialog_Force_20202_128,"Wow! Are you Magnolia? It's an honor to meet you! I've heard your songs, they're......beautiful!"
Dialog_Force_20202_129,"Oh, look, we run into your fans wherever we go."
Dialog_Force_20202_130,"Haha, thank you. Hope you can visit where I work."
Dialog_Force_20202_131,Yes! Of course!
Dialog_Force_20202_132,"I know this is rude, but I have to interrupt...after all, this isn't a safe place. Ladies, do you have reasons to be here?"
Dialog_Force_20202_133,"Yes, Irma and I were taking a walk. We just ended up here."
Dialog_Force_20202_134,"That's right, we later discovered that there were Raiders. So we hid ourselves here and waited for a chance to escape."
Dialog_Force_20202_135,"Ohhh. Rest assured ladies, the way out is quite safe, go back to Goodneighbor while you can."
Dialog_Force_20202_136,"Oh, ok. Thank you Paladin."
Dialog_Force_20202_137,Very honored!
Dialog_Force_20202_138,"Come and see my show as well, Paladin. Perhaps we can have a drink or two."
Dialog_Force_20202_139,I'd be h......
Dialog_Force_20202_140,No Paladin! Don't step on my toes!
Dialog_Force_20202_141,Uh...
Dialog_Force_20202_142,"Haha, we'll be on our way then. Hope to see you again soon."
Dialog_Force_20202_143,Don't worry Magnolia! I'll definitely be there!
Dialog_Force_20302_101,"Looks like our new friends are prepared, Glory, what about you?"
Dialog_Force_20302_102,"Yes, I'm ready. What do our new friends think of this task?"
Dialog_Force_20302_103,Hmm? Um...I want to finish the Raiders as soon as possible so I can go back to the Vault for a nice meal and a good rest.
Dialog_Force_20302_104,"......Glory, take care of our new friends."
Dialog_Force_20302_105,......I knew it wasn't that simple.
Dialog_Force_20302_106,Follow me. I'll show you what the Railroad is fighting for.
Dialog_Force_20302_107,Um...I think it's for freedom!
Dialog_Force_20302_108,......You don't know what freedom really is.
Dialog_Force_20302_109,How did you feel about eliminating all of those Synths?
Dialog_Force_20302_110,"Oh, they're all enemies. Plus, they were all robots. So I didn't feel anything."
Dialog_Force_20302_111,"Yes, they were robots, they were made by the Institute and coded for various tasks."
Dialog_Force_20302_112,"I'm actually a Synth, I was made with the third generation technology. Though the production process was technologically more advanced, there's really not much difference."
Dialog_Force_20302_113,"We have thoughts and feelings, just like humans. But you'll never understand the feeling of being controlled by codes and orders and never being able to fight back."
Dialog_Force_20302_114,Uh......
Dialog_Force_20302_115,Let's keep going.
Dialog_Force_20302_116,More Synths have been eliminated......this is the fate of tens and thousands of Synths.
Dialog_Force_20302_117,"They're either damaged during a mission, or discarded when they're old and broken. To put it in human terms, they are all dead."
Dialog_Force_20302_118,Only in death can we find complete freedom.
Dialog_Force_20302_119,But the Railroad gave us freedom when we are alive! So I joined the Railroad. I want to free all Synths and fight for their freedom!
Dialog_Force_20302_120,"This is the Railroad, this is what we want to do."
Dialog_Force_20302_121,"Do you understand? Or, can you understand?"
Dialog_Force_20302_122,I think I can understand a bit...but we just damaged a group of Synths......
Dialog_Force_20302_123,"They will be rescued. Maybe not now, but one day. I will do it."
Dialog_Force_30401_101,"Is everyone here? Our friends from the Vault are very punctual. So, let's talk about this mission."
Dialog_Force_30401_102,"Two Synths successfully escaped the Institute's control, but are currently being chased by the Institute. They are trapped somewhere here. We will be rescuing them."
Dialog_Force_30401_103,"So, that's the situation."
Dialog_Force_30401_104,We're quite professional when it comes to rescuing. Will Glory be joining us again?
Dialog_Force_30401_105,"Um, sorry, it's me this time. I will show you what I'm capable of."
Dialog_Force_30401_106,Wouldn't it be better if you took off your sunglasses?
Dialog_Force_30401_107,"Hey! No need to worry about this, I can find the way in this area even with my eyes closed. Come, follow me."
Dialog_Force_30401_108,"Just a bit more! They're nearby, we're getting close."
Dialog_Force_30401_109,"I want to know, have these rescue missions always been successful?"
Dialog_Force_30401_110,Nothing can always be successful. Of course there are bad times.
Dialog_Force_30401_111,"So you just try your best every time, right?"
Dialog_Force_30401_112,"Yeah, the slightest carelessness could cost me my life. Can't waste a limited life on infinite adventures."
Dialog_Force_30401_113,"Ha, it actually does seem infinite."
Dialog_Force_30401_114,There's something ahead......
Dialog_Force_30401_115,You are......
Dialog_Force_30401_116,We're the Railroad! You're safe!
Dialog_Force_30401_117,My god! You're the Railroad! We're saved!
Dialog_Force_30401_118,"Yes, don't worry. We will take you out of here."
Dialog_Force_30401_119,Yes! Yes! Phew...please take us out of here.
Dialog_Force_30401_120,There won't be any danger around here. Just give me one minute I will get you out.
Dialog_Force_30401_121,"Got it, no danger around here. We will be waiting till you get us out."
Dialog_Force_30401_122,...Is...is this Synth a bit too obvious?
Dialog_Force_30401_123,"Geez, surely he won't be able to fit in with such obvious repetition."
Dialog_Force_30401_124,Everyone in this world has their purpose. The same goes for Synths.
Dialog_Force_30401_125,Be reasonable.
Dialog_Force_30401_126,"That's not important, we have to be positive—we completed another mission with success. Let's take them out of here."
Dialog_Force_30402_101,Can't see anyone from the Railroad......but I can hear someone fighting. Hopefully we're not too late.
Dialog_Force_30402_102,"Let's get this over with, rescue them and leave."
Dialog_Force_30402_103,You started without us.
Dialog_Force_30402_104,My companion was in great danger. I can't sit around and wait for backup.
Dialog_Force_30402_105,"Ok ok, our friends from the Vault got here in time. We need your backup."
Dialog_Force_30402_106,"How about this Glory, me and these Vault Dwellers will make the rescue. You'll be on the lookout for any danger outside."
Dialog_Force_30402_107,"Ok, just go. There is no time to lose."
Dialog_Force_30402_108,She has a quick temper.
Dialog_Force_30402_109,Or she was given a quick temper.
Dialog_Force_30402_110,"Hey, this is not the time to make fun of people. Let's go."
Dialog_Force_30402_111,"Hi guys, so happy to see that you haven't lost a limb or anything. We really don't have any more parts to fix you."
Dialog_Force_30402_112,"Deacon, are you here to rescue me or to mock me?"
Dialog_Force_30402_113,I can do both. Are you able to follow us out?
Dialog_Force_30402_114,"Don't worry, members of the Railroad are not that weak."
Dialog_Force_30402_115,Good...um...Glory is here.
Dialog_Force_30402_116,Hurry up! I saw more hunters from the Institute coming this way!
Dialog_Force_30402_117,Woah! Let's go NOW!
Dialog_Force_30402_118,Why does this guy always talk so much?
Dialog_Force_20304_101,"Deacon, we're here. What do we need to do this time?"
Dialog_Force_20304_102,"Oh, good timing. It's quite safe around here. But let's go in before any Institute spies sees us."
Dialog_Force_20304_103,"Ok, no problem."
Dialog_Force_20304_104,This will make it hard for them to find us!
Dialog_Force_20304_105,"So careful, looks like this mission is very important."
Dialog_Force_20304_106,The mission isn't too important. We only need to get rid of some Raiders.
Dialog_Force_20304_107,Huh? Do we need to be hiding for this?
Dialog_Force_20304_108,"Hey, listen to me, the Railroad does the most dangerous tasks. If something goes slightly wrong, boom! Game over."
Dialog_Force_20304_109,......Then what are you doing cleaning up Raiders? It doesn't sound like it has anything to do with the Railroad.
Dialog_Force_20304_110,There's something you don't know. This place is actually a secret escape route the Railroad has maintained.
Dialog_Force_20304_111,Oh?
Dialog_Force_20304_112,"Under Dez's planning and instructions, we built many safe houses and escape routes. This is all because we do some of the most dangerous work on the Wasteland."
Dialog_Force_20304_113,That's why we need to prepare for the worst.
Dialog_Force_20304_114,"You should know, thanks to this kind of carefulness, we managed to teach the Institute many lessons."
Dialog_Force_20304_115,You're...wow...ok.
Dialog_Force_20304_116,"There won't be any Raiders here, at least for a short while. You can use this place with ease."
Dialog_Force_20304_117,"(Whistles) This was an easy mission, right?"
Dialog_Force_20304_118,It's nothing compared to what you're planning to do. Hope you'll reach your goal soon.
Dialog_Force_20304_119,Haha...our goal...maybe it's only a thought.
Dialog_Force_20304_120,"Don't sound so deep, it doesn't suit you."
Dialog_Force_20304_121,Hahaha! Exactly! You're absolutely right!
Dialog_Force_20402_101,We're here.
Dialog_Force_20402_102,"Confirmed. According to our information, the uncontrollable Synths are just ahead. The order is to eliminate them."
Dialog_Force_20402_103,"X6-88, lock down the outside. Me and these guys will deal with the Synths."
Dialog_Force_20402_104,Understood.
Dialog_Force_20402_105,"Oh, oh, wait. What do you think we are doing here? To be your hatchet men? I don't think so."
Dialog_Force_20402_106,"You're from the Vault after all, so the Father thought that you may not know the Commonwealth well enough, and that there might be some misunderstanding."
Dialog_Force_20402_107,Misunderstanding? Explain.
Dialog_Force_20402_108,"Come, I'll explain it to you."
Dialog_Force_20402_109,"Beating up these Synths, this is your explanation?"
Dialog_Force_20402_110,Look at their memory chips.
Dialog_Force_20402_111,What could there be? Um...orders?
Dialog_Force_20402_112,Their order was to eliminate mutant creatures? This...
Dialog_Force_20402_113,"See? These robots that you think are doing bad things on the Wasteland, are actually made to clean it up."
Dialog_Force_20402_114,"Under the Father's leadership, we are trying to change the Commonwealth Wasteland into a better place. No mutants, just pure hope and life."
Dialog_Force_20402_115,But these Synths have intensified the chaos. How do you explain this?
Dialog_Force_20402_116,"The longer they function, the more errors there will be, especially for the robots are executing combat orders. Of course there will be even more malfunctions."
Dialog_Force_20402_117,"But surely the Institute has a measure to fix it when they malfunction. For example, my order was to deal with these broken robots."
Dialog_Force_20402_118,"So what the Institute is trying to do is to make everything controllable, even problems."
Dialog_Force_20402_119,"So the rumor is true, you want to control the whole Commonwealth."
Dialog_Force_20402_120,"Is controlling so wrong? A Commonwealth with order, or a Commonwealth with chaos, which one do you prefer?"
Dialog_Force_20402_121,Let's not fight over this. We just want to know what the Institute thinks of our Vault?
Dialog_Force_20402_122,"Father has been very clear. As long as you're not in the way, the Institute will not be your enemy."
Dialog_Force_20402_123,"Ok, understood."
Dialog_Force_20403_101,"Kellogg, we're back."
Dialog_Force_20403_102,"Ha, you look very active. Take it easy, there are countless jobs."
Dialog_Force_20403_103,"We feel sorry for you Kellogg. 'There are countless jobs', but that's for you. There's only one job for us."
Dialog_Force_20403_104,"Haha! Fine, then you should put in more effort, I need to save mine for all the work I have to do."
Dialog_Force_20403_105,Whatever suits you. We will take care of our business.
Dialog_Force_20403_106,"Ah, young people..."
Dialog_Force_20403_107,"Kellogg, have you been lazy?"
Dialog_Force_20403_108,"Of course not! I'm a mercenary, I'm very reliable once paid."
Dialog_Force_20403_109,I will be watching you.
Dialog_Force_20403_110,What will you be watching me for? You should look out for those rebel Synths. They're the targets.
Dialog_Force_20403_111,Aren't these Synths here because of your Institute? You should be cleaning up your own mess.
Dialog_Force_20403_112,"Listen carefully, I'm a mercenary. I take money and do the job. Whoever made that mess has nothing to do with me."
Dialog_Force_20403_113,This is not what we heard. We know that you're the Institute's number one hatchet man. Is there anything you'd like to say to that?
Dialog_Force_20403_114,"Why are young people so stubborn? The Institute paid, I did the job. It was that simple. There's nothing else to say."
Dialog_Force_20403_115,"Alright, enough with this meaningless debate. Let's finish what we came for."
Dialog_Force_20403_116,That's right. Keep it up youngsters.
Dialog_Force_20403_117,"Ah, at last. My old limbs are nothing compare to you kids."
Dialog_Force_20403_118,Have you ever thought about retirement?
Dialog_Force_20403_119,Retirement? Hahaha! That's a great idea. Will I be living in your Vault if I actually retired?
Dialog_Force_20403_120,Uh......aren't there better places for you to be than our Vault?
Dialog_Force_20403_121,There probably won't be anywhere safer than your Vault.
Dialog_Force_20403_122,Uh......
Dialog_Force_20403_123,"Kids, you're just too young and naive."
Dialog_Force_20404_101,Kellogg......
Dialog_Force_20404_102,Hahaha! Remember what I said? There are countless jobs.
Dialog_Force_20404_103,Should we also take a break?
Dialog_Force_20404_104,I'm ok with that.
Dialog_Force_20404_105,"Hey hey hey, don't act like I'm not here. I heard everything."
Dialog_Force_20404_106,We were just trying to learn from you.
Dialog_Force_20404_107,Uhh...kids are so rude.
Dialog_Force_20404_108,"Kellogg, you're late."
Dialog_Force_20404_109,That won't matter once we win.
Dialog_Force_20404_110,"......Your target is inside, go get them."
Dialog_Force_20404_111,Of course.
Dialog_Force_20404_112,Is this dude the Overseer?
Dialog_Force_20404_113,"Ha, my money is on yes, he is. He's probably here to oversee you like crazy. Don't be lazy."
Dialog_Force_20404_114,......
Dialog_Force_20404_115,There are way too many escaped Synths...... This is very different from what you claim to be controllable.
Dialog_Force_20404_116,I don't represent the Institute. Who can really control everything that happens on the Wasteland?
Dialog_Force_20404_117,Then what is the Institute trying to do?
Dialog_Force_20404_118,Want some intel on the Institute? It'll cost you.
Dialog_Force_20404_119,Then tell me something free.
Dialog_Force_20404_120,It's not good to be so tight on your wallet at such a young age.
Dialog_Force_20404_121,Just tell me if you have intel or not.
Dialog_Force_20404_122,The Institute made these Synths as a weapon to free the Wasteland from mutants.
Dialog_Force_20404_123,"As for what the mutants are......well, I do know they came up with a new definition."
Dialog_Force_20404_124,What definition?
Dialog_Force_20404_125,"I'm sorry, that part is not free. It's actually quite pricey."
Dialog_Force_20404_126,......
Dialog_Force_20405_101,Target signal confirmed. It's definitely here.
Dialog_Force_20405_102,"He won't escape. Vault Dwellers, let us begin."
Dialog_Force_20405_103,"Yeah, ok, we'll help you."
Dialog_Force_20405_104,We will be completing the last step. You don't need to do anything.
Dialog_Force_20405_105,"X6-88, action."
Dialog_Force_20405_106,Got it.
Dialog_Force_20405_107,You won't escape.
Dialog_Force_20405_108,Oh no!! Please let me go. I've been providing services to the Institute for many years......
Dialog_Force_20405_109,It wouldn't have come to this is you followed the orders.
Dialog_Force_20405_110,"X6-88, do it."
Dialog_Force_20405_111,No!! No!!
Dialog_Force_20405_112,......I really want to know why the Synths are running away?
Dialog_Force_20405_113,You don't need to know.
Dialog_Force_20405_114,But I want to.
Dialog_Force_20405_115,"......just like other robots. System failure, wrong coding, things like these happen all the time."
Dialog_Force_20405_116,He didn't look malfunctioned to me.
Dialog_Force_20405_117,"You don't get it. Escaping control is malfunction. Either fix it or throw it away, this is the Institute's way."
Dialog_Force_20405_118,Then you should have tried to fix him first.
Dialog_Force_20405_119,He didn't want to be fixed. And he chose to run away.
Dialog_Force_20405_120,The problem has been solved. We have the memory chip.
Dialog_Force_20405_121,Then our mission has been completed. Thanks for your Vault's assistance.
Dialog_Force_20405_122,"God, I really don't want to be in another mission like this."
Dialog_Force_20405_123,"Yes, please tell your Father that our Vault will not be participating in missions like this."
Dialog_Force_20405_124,"I can understand. Father just wanted to show you what we do. Don't interfere with the Institute's business, that's our deal."
Dialog_Force_20405_125,"Yes, we won't forget."
Dialog_Hero_8010200_101,Hello! We asked for your help this time for nothing but the Gunners... They are actually pursuing us.
Dialog_Hero_8010200_102,Those Gunners again! What are they always so unrelenting towards you?
Dialog_Hero_8010200_103,"It's all because of that traitor, Clint. He betrayed the Minutemen! He caused our defeat! Of course he never wants to see another Minutemen!"
Dialog_Hero_8010200_104,"He won't get what he wants! As long as I'm around, I'll find a way to rebuild the Minutemen! In the end..."
Dialog_Hero_8010200_105,I will take everything from him! In the name of the Minutemen!
Dialog_Hero_8010400_101,Remember the Gunners we eliminated in Lexington apartments? Later I found out that they were only a scouting group of the Gunners pursuing us.
Dialog_Hero_8010400_102,You mean...
Dialog_Hero_8010400_103,"Yes, we intercepted some message. More Gunners are on their way. Fortunately, we know which path they are taking."
Dialog_Hero_8010400_104,This is it! The Cambridge highway! This is where we intercept them!
Dialog_Hero_8010400_105,I think your intel is accurate... I see them already!
Dialog_Hero_6010100_101,"First, thanks for your help again. You helped us repel the pursuit of the Gunners. I believe they will lay low for sometime, giving us some room to breathe."
Dialog_Hero_6010100_102,"Heh, that's good! We are also disgusted by the Gunners. Even though they are not difficult to deal with. They are like flies that won't go away."
Dialog_Hero_6010100_103,Don't underestimate them. We will run into them again. Of course. We have time to do our own things now.
Dialog_Hero_6010100_104,"The Minutemen contacted a group of settlers in Concord. They don't trust us enough to join, unless..."
Dialog_Hero_6010100_105,"We know they are short on resources. If we can solve their problem and establish trust, the Minutemen will be able to win them over."
Dialog_Hero_16010200_101,We ran into some trouble... a few settlers have been infected by disease. Many of them have already collapsed.
Dialog_Hero_16010200_102,"The medicine that the Minutemen collected are all used up. We need more, so I was hoping to find some medication here..."
Dialog_Hero_16010200_103,"Got it. This truly is urgent business. Don't worry, you have our full support."
Dialog_Hero_16010200_104,Thank you! The Minutemen and the settlers are in your debt!
Dialog_Hero_7010300_101,Hi! Preston! Are you in trouble again?
Dialog_Hero_7010300_102,"Yes, I received a distress call from a settlement saying that a settler has been kidnapped and need the ransom delivered here."
Dialog_Hero_7010300_103,"Oh, so you are here to deliver the ransom?"
Dialog_Hero_7010300_104,You can put it that way. But the Raiders cannot leave with the ransom. I'm in charge here.
Dialog_Hero_7010300_105,I feel sorry for those guys...
Dialog_Hero_7010300_106,Thank god! I'm saved!
Dialog_Hero_7010300_107,"Yes, don't be afraid. The exit is safe, return to you settlement at once."
Dialog_Hero_7010300_108,Thank you! Thank you so much! I will return at once.
Dialog_Hero_7010300_109,"All right, rescue succeed. We'll retreat."
Dialog_Hero_17010300_101,Is this the Back Bay sewers? This looks really bad. I can imagine lots of mutated beings down here.
Dialog_Hero_17010300_102,I've also heard rumors about a murderer hiding down here. But not a living soul has ever seen him.
Dialog_Hero_17010300_103,It's just a rumor. There are lot's of mutated beings down here after all. They are all dangerous.
Dialog_Hero_17010300_104,I really hope that it's just a rumor. The world is cruel enough. We don't need someone like him.
Dialog_Hero_17010300_105,"All right, put yourselves together. Let's clear out this place for the settlers."
Dialog_Hero_21010400_101,You're here! Did you see any caravans on your way here? I heard a caravan will be passing by...
Dialog_Hero_21010400_102,"We didn't see... hang on, there's someone ahead, a caravan?"
Dialog_Hero_21010400_103,Let me see... oh no! Raiders! They're charging at us! Prepare for battle!
Dialog_Hero_21010400_104,What a pity... Maybe my intel was wrong. No caravans pass through here. They must have changed their route because of the Raiders.
Dialog_Hero_21010400_105,Looks like we did it for nothing this time. The settlers want to trade some resources.
Dialog_Hero_21010400_106,"This is out of your control, Preston."
Dialog_Hero_21010400_107,Yeah... this is out of my control. That's why we need to work harder.
Dialog_Hero_23010200_101,We've prepared a batch of resources to distribute to the settlements across Concord. But we need to make a manifest to make sure nothing is misplaced.
Dialog_Hero_23010200_102,So we're here to make a manifest?
Dialog_Hero_23010200_103,Or find some materials to make the manifest.
Dialog_Hero_23010200_104,Understood! Piece of cake.
Dialog_Hero_23010200_105,"Yes, no trouble at all. We need your help on the distribution too."
Dialog_Hero_23010200_106,... That wasn't our agreement...
Dialog_Hero_22010400_101,Are the Gunners you mentioned here?
Dialog_Hero_22010400_102,"Yes, we discovered lots of Gunner activity here, but we don't know what they are up to."
Dialog_Hero_22010400_103,Who cares! Definitely up to no good! Everything will be solved if we eliminate them.
Dialog_Hero_22010400_104,Let's move!
Dialog_Hero_22010400_105,No problem.
Dialog_Hero_16010100_101,"I'm glad to see you! I'm prepared this time. With your help, all the mutants here are done for."
Dialog_Hero_16010100_102,"I got a sense of revenge in your words, a very strong sense of revenge."
Dialog_Hero_16010100_103,"Ha! Revenge? No no no, this is a sweep quest to destroy the mutants. This has always been the creed of the Brotherhood."
Dialog_Hero_16010100_104,We maintain order and justice in the world. It must not fall into evil and chaos. A man of faith will never succumb to the fallen. We will change it!
Dialog_Hero_16010100_105,This is the creed of the Brotherhood of Steel. It is also the sworn duty of a Brotherhood of Steel Paladin such as myself.
Dialog_Hero_7010100_101,"According to our scouts, there are lots of mutants here! Also some robots produced by uncontrolled technology..."
Dialog_Hero_7010100_102,Wait! You mean... hang on... the Brotherhood wants to destroy these hard working robots too?
Dialog_Hero_7010100_103,"Yeah, what's the problem? Correcting the abuse of technology is also part of our creed, our duty."
Dialog_Hero_7010100_104,"Hang on! They're just machines, created by human to help themselves. They've done nothing wrong."
Dialog_Hero_7010100_105,You're wrong! It is because of this unrestricted use of technology and development that made the world like this. No one has ever considered the dangers of technology...
Dialog_Hero_7010100_106,Stop! Just say what you want to do.
Dialog_Hero_7010100_107,Wipe out all these heathens.
Dialog_Hero_7010100_108,Sorry... do it yourself. We are not the Brotherhood. We won't trade one extreme for another.
Dialog_Hero_7010100_109,"Although I don't like compromise, but I regard you as partners ... Since you are against it, let's eliminate the dangerous monster first. Do you agree?"
Dialog_Hero_16010400_101,"After our last argument, I didn't think you would respond to my request."
Dialog_Hero_16010400_102,"We're not that stingy, Danse. Even though we have different beliefs, we are still your partner."
Dialog_Hero_16010400_103,"I'm glad to hear that, and I am very touched. I will cherish our friendship."
Dialog_Hero_16010400_104,What are we doing this time?
Dialog_Hero_16010400_105,"Scouting, just scouting. I need more scouting information in this area in order to analyze if the Brotherhood can establish control here."
Dialog_Hero_16010400_106,"No problem, it is a simple mission. I'm curious, other than the Brotherhood missions, do you have any... er... personal goals?"
Dialog_Hero_16010400_107,Aren't they one and the same? I am a Brotherhood of Steel Paladin. My goal is to complete every quest from the Brotherhood of Steel.
Dialog_Hero_16010400_108,Never mind...
Dialog_Hero_16010400_109,Aren't you adorable asking him that...
Dialog_Hero_21010200_101,"Come, Police Precinct 8 is waiting for us. Here we have lots of information about west Boston. You can take whatever you need."
Dialog_Hero_21010200_102,"Besides, no one will stop you other than the dirty mutants. And that's nothing to worry about."
Dialog_Hero_21010200_103,"Because I will end them with a bullet! Every time I put one of them down, I feel that the world is one step closer to being normal. It is a wonderful feeling."
Dialog_Hero_21010200_104,Aren't you looking forward to it?
Dialog_Hero_21010400_201,"Even though the Brotherhood is currently facing some problems, we still want to improve the local development of the Brotherhood."
Dialog_Hero_21010400_202,We've tried different methods to strengthen the Brotherhood. But the lack of resources remains a major issue for us.
Dialog_Hero_21010400_203,"Hopefully, with your help, we can gather enough resources for the development of the Brotherhood."
Dialog_Hero_21010400_204,This guy sure talks a lot...
Dialog_Hero_21010400_205,"All right, let's move."
Dialog_Hero_17010200_101,Our scouts discovered Vault 81 here. It is nothing like your Vault. This one is full of mutated Mole Rats.
Dialog_Hero_17010200_102,"You know, the Brotherhood does not tolerate these things. They are the evolutionary errors of this world. Our duty is to correct these errors."
Dialog_Hero_17010200_103,"All right, all right. We get it. Let's do this."
Dialog_Hero_17010200_104,Good! You will join hands with the Brotherhood and make contributions to this world.
Dialog_Hero_17010200_105,Just... do it...
Dialog_Hero_22010600_101,Hubris Comics... Comics used to bring imagination to this world. And imagination give wings to people's thoughts.
Dialog_Hero_22010600_102,"But now, the wings are broken, freedom is lost, the world is in ruins..."
Dialog_Hero_22010600_103,"Maybe I need to remind you, poet Danse, these Ghouls don't appreciate your talent on poetry."
Dialog_Hero_22010600_104,That's why I hate Ghouls. They don't appreciate anything.
Dialog_Hero_22010600_105,"They know how delicious you are, Danse."
Dialog_Hero_22010100_101,"Vault 114, when I first read about it, I thought some lame dude made it up. I can't believe it's real..."
Dialog_Hero_22010100_102,"We are at the door of Vault 114. What is your plan, Danse?"
Dialog_Hero_22010100_103,"Isn't it obvious? Knock the door open and politely ask, ""Dear sirs and madams, the world is dangerous. For your safety, please buy Brotherhood Insurance."""
Dialog_Hero_22010100_104,And if they refuse?
Dialog_Hero_22010100_105,"Oh, a minor setback. We will need to find some Ghouls and show them an exhibition. They will learn that the insurance is worth every penny."
Dialog_Hero_22010100_106,"I'm afraid your insurance business won't work, Danse. Unless you do your business with Raiders."
Dialog_Hero_22010100_107,"Hmph, I'll go bankrupt if I do business with them. I'm not stupid."
Dialog_Hero_21010300_101,"Hello, Vault Dwellers. I invited you here for a few reasons. One, I know you are reliable. Two, I got a new case in regards to a theft."
Dialog_Hero_21010300_102,"According to the clues, I believe the thief is in this area. I guess he also stashes his stolen goods here..."
Dialog_Hero_21010300_103,"So, either we find the thief or find the stolen goods, the case will be closed. It's simple like that, right?"
Dialog_Hero_21010300_104,What is this...? I... this makes no sense! My clues can not be wrong. They must be around here somewhere!
Dialog_Hero_21010300_105,There must be a mistake! But that can't be me...
Dialog_Hero_21010300_201,"Vault dwellers, we're here again. After carefully thinking about last time, I believe my luck ran out."
Dialog_Hero_21010300_202,I hope you can search this place with me again. I have a hunch that we will find something today.
Dialog_Hero_21010300_203,"Maybe you find it strange, instincts of a Synth. It is not that strange, actually. Instinct is a result of probabilities, it..."
Dialog_Hero_21010300_204,"Okay okay, Mr. Detective, we believe you! Let's begin."
Dialog_Hero_21010300_205,Of course! I found it! This is it! This is the item my client described! That means I am right. I am just unlucky sometimes.
Dialog_Hero_21010300_206,"Whatever makes you happy, detective."
Dialog_Hero_21010300_301,"Here again, hope you don't vomit. Reason? We found the missing item. But the thieves are still out there. So we are not done here."
Dialog_Hero_21010300_302,"If we don't get rid of the thieves, they will steal again. I might have to come back again. In that case, vomiting will not regulate your emotions.."
Dialog_Hero_21010300_303,"You understand where I'm coming from, right?"
Dialog_Hero_21010300_304,"See, we did it. From now on, I won't have to deal with these boring cases again. And you won't have to worry about vomiting."
Dialog_Hero_22010200_101,You're also from a Vault. Have you ever heard of Vault 114? My client wants to find the location of Vault 114.
Dialog_Hero_22010200_102,"Truth is, we don't have any connections with other Vaults."
Dialog_Hero_22010200_103,I thought so. I heard every Vault was a social experiment. What was the purpose of your Vault?
Dialog_Hero_22010200_104,Umm... let's drop the subject. Our Vault lady will think you know too much.
Dialog_Hero_22010200_105,"Really? This is a question with complicated answers. What an uncomfortable sensation... Yes, Synths can get uncomfortable too. The signal arrays get..."
Dialog_Hero_22010200_106,Let's just finish your task. Find the entrance to Vault 114 so we can return.
Dialog_Hero_22010300_101,"Detective, is it true? People have gone missing in Trinity Tower?"
Dialog_Hero_22010300_102,"This is my fifth request, I'm sure of it."
Dialog_Hero_22010300_103,You didn't look into the previous four...?
Dialog_Hero_22010300_104,There are always reports of missing people in all corners of the Commonwealth. Trinity Tower is not an exception because speaking in terms of quantitative distribution...
Dialog_Hero_22010300_105,Stop! Put it in layman's terms!
Dialog_Hero_22010300_106,... I didn't pay attention to it in the beginning.
Dialog_Hero_22010300_107,"Hmm, okay. Let's look into it."
Dialog_Hero_22010300_108,Finally. The mutants are responsible for the missing persons. I believe we can close the case now...
Dialog_Hero_22010300_109,"But they acted very organized, which means.... they should have a leader..."
Dialog_Hero_22010300_110,"All right, detective, let's report back first."
Dialog_Hero_23010500_101,Welcome to a joint quest with our Railroad agents. This means you know the Railroad and its business.
Dialog_Hero_23010500_102,This is the Old Corner Bookstore. It is an important place for the Railroad agents to report intel.
Dialog_Hero_23010500_103,"Every Synth rescue quest began with intel. Our rival, the Institute, is not useless."
Dialog_Hero_23010500_104,"In fact, they are very powerful!"
Dialog_Hero_23010500_105,And you still want to destroy the Institute?
Dialog_Hero_23010500_106,"Destroy? Oh no, that's not what we are after... at least only in our dreams."
Dialog_Hero_23010500_107,We just want to rescue as many Synths as possible. Maybe someday it will be enough.... who knows?
Dialog_Hero_22010600_201,You're here in the nick of time! We have a situation here.
Dialog_Hero_22010600_202,Our agents were identified by the Institute spies while gathering intel. The spies tracked them all the way here.
Dialog_Hero_22010600_203,Help us take care of the spies.
Dialog_Hero_22010600_204,"Done, let's move."
Dialog_Hero_22010500_101,Hey! It's great to see you. I have a strong backup now.
Dialog_Hero_22010500_102,"What's your trouble? Make it quick, we're busy."
Dialog_Hero_22010500_103,Ha ha. Some Synths escaped from the Institute. They should be coming to our headquarters via the old subway tunnels.
Dialog_Hero_22010500_104,"But there are Raiders here. In their opinion, Synths are just materials on foot. Please help us take care of the Raiders."
Dialog_Hero_22010500_105,"No problem. In our opinion, Raiders are just materials on foot."
Dialog_Hero_22010500_106,That's right! I knew you were reliable!
Dialog_Action_800110103_101,"We have be exploring the Glowing Sea for a while now. Like we said before, we are here looking for someone."
Dialog_Action_800110103_102,"Yes, we already know the basics, someone sent us a message by radio and requested us to find a person in the Glowing Sea."
Dialog_Action_800110103_103,Okay. But let's go over the details now. The person we are looking for is a Super Mutant.
Dialog_Action_800110103_104,What?! Did I hear it you correctly?
Dialog_Action_800110103_105,"You heard me right. In fact it is probably easier for us to find a Super Mutant, since they are big and easy to spot."
Dialog_Action_800110103_106,"Wait, that's not what I was going to say. Why are we looking for a Super Mutant?"
Dialog_Action_800110103_107,"Hmm, good question. Give me a second so I can try to explain this to you."
Dialog_Action_800110103_108,"Ok, I'll leave the combat to the professionals. Haylen and I will scout around. Good luck and take care!"
Dialog_Action_800110103_109,"If you come across any interesting pieces of tech, be sure to let me know."
Dialog_Action_800110103_110,"You can leave it to us, ladies!"
Dialog_Action_800110103_111,"So, Mr Detective? Your explanation is? Why are we looking for a Super Mutant?"
Dialog_Action_800110103_112,"Ok, our client made it clear that his friend, this person we are searching for, might have been turned into a Super Mutant on acciddent."
Dialog_Action_800110103_113,hmm?
Dialog_Action_800110103_114,Ah yes. That's my point. You ever seen anyone turned into a Super Mutant before?
Dialog_Action_800110103_115,!!!
Dialog_Action_800110103_116,You aren't saying that...
Dialog_Action_800110103_117,"Exactly, that's why I joined this operation. I want to know who this Super Mutant is, and how they turned into a Super Mutant."
Dialog_Action_800110103_118,"Well, now I need a sec to figure out what that's supposed to mean..."
Dialog_Action_800110103_119,"It's obvious, there is no Super Mutant here."
Dialog_Action_800110103_120,"Right sir, I appreciate it you always telling us what is going on."
Dialog_Action_800110103_121,"Of course. Clearly we still have to look further into it, to find our target in this Glowing Sea."
Dialog_Action_800110103_122,"Speaking of looking for someone, who is more experienced than us... I just got used to it, clear and simple."
Dialog_Action_800110107_101,"Now it's been a while, still haven't found what we are looking for yet?"
Dialog_Action_800110107_102,"Relax. As professional private eye, finding people is my specialty. We understand your feelings. Compared to the actual finding, I'd say the process is more enjoyable."
Dialog_Action_800110107_103,Huh?
Dialog_Action_800110107_104,Then have you found any old tech? I've thoroughly studied the circuits we have. There's nothing interesting.
Dialog_Action_800110107_105,Our primary target is finding that person. I'd say let's keep searching this place.
Dialog_Action_800110107_106,"Right, this is not something that can be rushed."
Dialog_Action_800110107_107,"All right, just take care and pay attention."
Dialog_Action_800110107_108,No problem.
Dialog_Action_800110107_109,It doesn't look like there's a Super Mutant here.
Dialog_Action_800110107_110,We don't know that yet. Let's finish our searching here first.
Dialog_Action_800110107_111,The places where Super Mutants make their homes are all stinky and messy. It's nothing like what we have here.
Dialog_Action_800110107_112,You're right I guess. I don't want to see too many of them myself.
Dialog_Action_800110107_113,You mean it's hard to distinguish them?
Dialog_Action_800110107_114,I mean we may kill our target by mistake.
Dialog_Action_800110107_115,"Mr Detective, you've got everything on point."
Dialog_Action_800110107_116,"Ok, it's over. We didn't find the target here."
Dialog_Action_800110107_117,Did you find anything?
Dialog_Action_800110107_118,"Yeah I'm glad we didn't. If we do find the Super Mutant, I worry we may kill him first ...."
Dialog_Action_800110107_119,I'm sorry?
Dialog_Action_800110107_120,"Haha, just a joke, take it easy..."
Dialog_Action_800110107_121,"Ok, that's this area checked out. Let's prepare to go to the next place."
Dialog_Action_800110107_122,Let's go see Haylen.
Dialog_Action_800110107_123,"Wait, I haven't asked if there is..."
Dialog_Action_800110107_124,There will be. Let's head out.
Dialog_Action_800110107_125,Hmmmm that was odd.
Dialog_Action_800110113_101,Did you find anything of interest?
Dialog_Action_800110113_102,Just enemies.
Dialog_Action_800110113_103,Are they interesting?
Dialog_Action_800110113_104,Interesting to see them get beaten.
Dialog_Action_800110113_105,Our main goal is to look for the person. We didn't find anything interesting except circuit boards and broken circuits.
Dialog_Action_800110113_106,"All right. Keep looking, Doctor Li and I will keep scouting around."
Dialog_Action_800110113_107,"Sure, take care."
Dialog_Action_800110113_108,You too.
Dialog_Action_800110113_109,"Pity, still nothing found here."
Dialog_Action_800110113_110,"It doesn't matter, if anyone could find anyone it would be you!"
Dialog_Action_800110113_111,"Mr Detective, you are right!"
Dialog_Action_800110113_112,So enjoy the process.
Dialog_Action_800110113_113,I just want to be done with it.
Dialog_Action_800110129_101,"Phew, it's not easy searching for so long in here. Are you prepared for the next part..."
Dialog_Action_800110129_102,"Mr. Detective, this time I'll follow your lead."
Dialog_Action_800110129_103,Are you sure Doc?
Dialog_Action_800110129_104,Yes I am.
Dialog_Action_800110129_105,"Okay, then I can relax a little now. Haylen, let's go find something interesting."
Dialog_Action_800110129_106,Like what?
Dialog_Action_800110129_107,That depends...
Dialog_Action_800110129_108,"How are you Doc, you feeling okay?"
Dialog_Action_800110129_109,I'll make it. Relax.
Dialog_Action_800110129_110,"I'm curious, why are you here searching with us?"
Dialog_Action_800110129_111,"Nothing special, just want to explore with you."
Dialog_Action_800110129_112,"Yes, enjoy the process, let's continue."
Dialog_Action_800110129_113,Right.
Dialog_Action_800110129_114,Is this the end of the line?
Dialog_Action_800110129_115,Looks like it. We still didn't find anything. This quest...
Dialog_Action_800110129_116,....
Dialog_Action_800110129_117,There is nothing we can do now. Let's finish searching here and get out.
Dialog_Action_800110129_118,...
Dialog_Action_800110129_119,Let's go Doc.
Dialog_Action_800110129_120,Is that really....oh my god..
Dialog_Action_800110129_121,"... come on, I don't want you to see me like this."
Dialog_Action_800110211_101,"Be careful! According to our scout's report, it's pretty darn dangerous in here."
Dialog_Action_800110211_102,"Yeah, I heard this place is a mess. Enemy might keep showing up that we can't possibly clear them all."
Dialog_Action_800110211_103,"Frankly, we need to be more careful in here. Don't try to break in if you find the enemy is too strong."
Dialog_Action_800110211_104,"OK, got it."
Dialog_Action_800110211_105,"Phew, it's not as hard as it seems."
Dialog_Action_800110211_106,It's always easy at the beginning but gets tougher later on.
Dialog_Action_800110211_107,"Heh heh, now I'm starting to look forward to it."
Dialog_Action_800110211_108,"Same as always, do what you can. Now let's keep moving."
Dialog_Action_800112101_101,"It has only been a few days, why does it feel different?"
Dialog_Action_800112101_102,"Those monsters seem to be even more fierce, is it my illusion?"
Dialog_Action_800112101_103,"Rather than becoming fierce, they seem to be afraid of something ..."
Dialog_Action_800112101_104,Watch out! They're charging this way!
Dialog_Action_800112113_101,So this is the cause of mutations around here.
Dialog_Action_800112113_102,"Yes, the Ghouls and Mole Rats have been frightened. The Mirelurks on the other hand are very excited......"
Dialog_Action_800112113_103,I always feel like they're watching us. Are Mirelurks smart enough to observe us?
Dialog_Action_800112113_104,"If you keep standing there doing nothing, you'll be dumber than a Mirelurk!"
Dialog_Action_800112113_105,Darn it! It seems to have left a layer of shell and escaped from the ground.
Dialog_Action_800112113_106,Its den should be around here somewhere. Let me check the map......
Dialog_Action_800112113_107,It must be the most dangerous place in this area. Let's prepare ourselves before we leave!
Dialog_Action_800111101_101,I remember this place. We passed here when we escaped Quincy. So I'll lead the way.
Dialog_Action_800111101_102,"No problem, Glory and I will check around this new environment. Come Glory."
Dialog_Action_800111101_103,......
Dialog_Action_800111101_104,Let's get started. Find out the current state of the Gunners without startling them.
Dialog_Action_800111101_105,Preston!
Dialog_Action_800111101_106,"Oh no, he recognized me! We can't let him tell the others!"
Dialog_Action_800111101_107,"Oh! Will you look at that, it's Preston!"
Dialog_Action_800111101_108,Darn it! This Triggerman knows me! Uhm......
Dialog_Action_800111101_109,Preston! Why are you here!
Dialog_Action_800111101_110,......Shoot! Why do they all know me?
Dialog_Action_800111101_111,You're an icon!
Dialog_Action_800111101_112,......Just get it over with!
Dialog_Action_800111101_113,......
Dialog_Action_800111101_114,"Preston, what are you thinking?"
Dialog_Action_800111101_115,Looks like most Gunners here recognize me. What should I do? I'm concerned that we might expose ourselves.
Dialog_Action_800111101_116,"True, this is a problem. Maybe you can have a makeover?"
Dialog_Action_800111101_117,I have another set of clothes. But I didn't bring it with me......
Dialog_Action_800111101_118,"You mean the general costume? Sorry, but that would make it even worse."
Dialog_Action_800111101_119,"Never mind, I'm here. Finding intel is the most important thing. Let's continue."
Dialog_Action_800111104_101,About what happened last time......I had a discussion with Deacon and he suggested that I should stay inside. Maybe this is for the best.
Dialog_Action_800111104_102,So?
Dialog_Action_800111104_103,"So I'll be joining you this time, haha! Finally!"
Dialog_Action_800111104_104,......
Dialog_Action_800111104_105,"Don't worry, agents of the Railroad can find intel in the most difficult circumstances! It's a piece of cake, right Glory?"
Dialog_Action_800111104_106,......shouldn't we......
Dialog_Action_800111104_107,"Preston, show her around. All she needs to do is cover for us. Come on, let's get started!"
Dialog_Action_800111104_108,Oh! These Gunners are worthy opponents. But still not good enough.
Dialog_Action_800111104_109,"We came here to see what the Gunners are up to, not to wreck them......I am assuming a professional agent you have found something valuable?"
Dialog_Action_800111104_110,"Yes, of course. These Gunners are all scattered here, which shows they are idle. Idle means there's nothing big going on, so no trouble."
Dialog_Action_800111104_111,"Hmm, makes sense......"
Dialog_Action_800111104_112,This is a good time for us to take them down one by one! Come on! Let's surprise them!
Dialog_Action_800111104_113,......Why did I believe he what he said......
Dialog_Action_800111104_114,"Hmm, there's nothing here. What a pity. I haven't had enough fun."
Dialog_Action_800111104_115,Did you come here for fun?
Dialog_Action_800111104_116,"To be honest, yes. Why else would I be here?"
Dialog_Action_800111104_117,To collect the intel Preston needs! He needs intel!
Dialog_Action_800111104_118,We have that already. These Gunners had nothing in plan. We helped Preston make a good start on his attacks!
Dialog_Action_800111104_119,......that makes sense......
Dialog_Action_800111104_120,God! How could you believe what he said......
Dialog_Action_800111104_121,Trust me! Everything's fine!
Dialog_Action_800111110_101,"Deacon gave me a lot of useful information after the last mission, so this time......"
Dialog_Action_800111110_102,No! We will not work with him again!
Dialog_Action_800111110_103,Why???
Dialog_Action_800111110_104,You talk too much.
Dialog_Action_800111110_105,What kind of reason is that?
Dialog_Action_800111110_106,We just don't want to work with you. We choose Glory.
Dialog_Action_800111110_107,This isn't fair! And Glory won't agree......
Dialog_Action_800111110_108,"Oh, I'd be happy to."
Dialog_Action_800111110_109,Wha-?
Dialog_Action_800111110_110,Then this is it.
Dialog_Action_800111110_111,"Ok, Deacon and I will be on the lookout."
Dialog_Action_800111110_112,Glory! How could you......
Dialog_Action_800111110_113,"This is Dec's mission, is it not?"
Dialog_Action_800111110_114,......
Dialog_Action_800111110_115,You seem......
Dialog_Action_800111110_116,(Gazing coldly) ...
Dialog_Action_800111110_117,"Uh, haha! It has been great with your help!"
Dialog_Action_800111110_118,(Gazing coldly) ...
Dialog_Action_800111110_119,Haha...haha...please continue.
Dialog_Action_800111110_120,We're pretty much done here......Do you think we've got everything? Glory?
Dialog_Action_800111110_121,(Gazing coldly) ...
Dialog_Action_800111110_122,Mhmm...I think so. There shouldn't be anything else...
Dialog_Action_800111110_123,(Gazing coldly) ...
Dialog_Action_800111110_124,Hahaha......let's go. Everything should be fine......
Dialog_Action_800111110_125,(Gazing coldly) ...
Dialog_Action_800111123_101,......
Dialog_Action_800111123_102,......
Dialog_Action_800111123_103,Hm? Where's Glory?
Dialog_Action_800111123_104,She said she finished her mission and left.
Dialog_Action_800111123_105,......
Dialog_Action_800111123_106,"Oh! So unreliable! I'm very sorry. To make it up for her actions, I will be joining you this time. I will......"
Dialog_Action_800111123_107,No!!!
Dialog_Action_800111123_108,Let me do it this time.
Dialog_Action_800111123_109,Huh? Aren't you worried about being recognized?
Dialog_Action_800111123_110,"I'll have to face it sooner or later. Plus, you told me when you got back last time that it was a good time to weaken them. It should be fine if we don't leave behind any witnesses......"
Dialog_Action_800111123_111,That's why I am perfect the job!
Dialog_Action_800111123_112,"I think that's very reasonable. I will do it myself. So, Vault Dwellers, let's go together."
Dialog_Action_800111123_113,Hey! Hey! Listen to me!
Dialog_Action_800111123_114,Come on! Let's go!
Dialog_Action_800111123_115,Hey!!
Dialog_Action_800111123_116,"Preston, you're very decisive today."
Dialog_Action_800111123_117,"Yes, I was on the lookout with Deacon last time. I think it's for the best that I stay away from him."
Dialog_Action_800111123_118,Hahahaha!
Dialog_Action_800111123_119,Maybe Desdemona thinks this too......
Dialog_Action_800111123_120,Oh? Really?
Dialog_Action_800111123_121,Who knows. We should keep going.
Dialog_Action_800111123_122,"I think this is enough. Deacon is right, the Gunners are very lazy right now. It's not like they'll be doing anything big."
Dialog_Action_800111123_123,That means......
Dialog_Action_800111123_124,Our reconstruction in the Commonwealth shouldn't be too problematic.
Dialog_Action_800111123_125,But I'll make the Gunners pay for what happened in Quincy!
Dialog_Action_800111123_126,"Yes, that's for sure. We can't let them go that easily."
Dialog_Action_800111123_127,......Clint......wait for me.
Dialog_Action_800111214_101,All the treasures are mine!
Dialog_Action_800111214_102,"Since the mongrel are here, we will find a lot of resources."
Dialog_Action_800111214_103,Who...who are you! Are you coming for me treasures?
Dialog_Action_800111214_104,"No, relax. We just want to know where did you find the treasure in your hand?"
Dialog_Action_800111214_105,No...no! I don't trust you!
Dialog_Action_800111214_106,Help! Someone help me!
Dialog_Action_800111214_107,Oh gosh who is the raider!
Dialog_Action_800111215_101,Don't you think this smell is familiar?
Dialog_Action_800111215_102,"It brings me up the ugly ""queen."" And also a smell of burnt."
Dialog_Action_800111215_103,"Since the smell of burnt is still here, is it the one we know?"
Dialog_Action_800111215_104,Can't be! We shot it like a thousand times!
Dialog_Action_800111215_105,Seems like we underestimate its ability to escape. Let's go get it this time.
Dialog_Action_800111215_106,I hope the stove in Vault is hot enough for fresh meat.
Dialog_Action_890101001_101,"(Voice down) Very well, challengers, seems you've got the spirit! But soon you'll know Mechanist's challenge is no child play!"
Dialog_Action_890101001_102,You shall need to deal with various emergencies... (Squeak) Make sure...cough...(Voice down) Make sure your team could tackle these challenges! Mwhahaha!
Dialog_Action_890101001_103,Why did you set them? What's your purpose?
Dialog_Action_890101001_104,Right! And why do you sound like a little girl at times? Why can't you talk to us in person?
Dialog_Action_890101001_105,(Mechanist's voice in panic) You... What are you talking about? Who's a little girl? Why so many questions?! Why can't you just be good and finish your trials?!
Dialog_Action_890101001_106,This guy...seems a bit curious...
Dialog_Action_890101001_107,"Ha, even a fool could tell this ""Mechanist"" is disguised by a little girl... But we'd better be patient with her petty scheme."
Dialog_Action_990700201_101,"Wait, aren't we tracking down the legendary Nian? What are we doing here in this stinky den of moles!"
Dialog_Action_990700201_102,"(Scratch head) How am I supposed to know? Since it's a legendary creature, it must be quite special. Perhaps these moles are his minions!"
Dialog_Action_990700201_103,You're barking at the moon...
Dialog_Action_990700201_104,"Perhaps behind the moles is a giant mole king that speaks human language and keeps a bunch of human followers... Perhaps this giant mole king is the real ""Nian""!"
Dialog_Action_990700201_105,Enough of your nonsense. Let's deal with these moles first!
Dialog_Action_990700201_106,"Ah, vault dwellers, how are you? Thanks for helping me get rid of these annoying mole thieves!"
Dialog_Action_990700201_107,What?
Dialog_Action_990700201_108,They stole my new research result! What a naughty bunch!
Dialog_Action_990700201_109,Research result? What's that?
Dialog_Action_990700201_110,"Oh, you know, I often send my synth minions to work for me. The new year's coming. Although they're but a bunch of synths, they need a little stimulus, right?"
Dialog_Action_990700201_111,So?
Dialog_Action_990700201_112,"So I invented a ""Red Minion Data Stimulus System"", the ""Red packet"" for short, used to reward my hard-working synth minions..."
Dialog_Action_990700201_113,"But my ""Red packets"" were stolen by these naughty moles! Thanks, or else I won't be able to give them out."
Dialog_Action_990700201_114,Um... Well... You're welcome... Happy new year!
Dialog_Action_990700201_115,Happy new year!
Dialog_Action_990700205_101,Where's this cursed Nian? We were supposed to stay in the warm vault and eat delicious roasted potatoes and Brahmin steak...
Dialog_Action_990700205_102,But now we're searching this ruins in freezing winds for a food thief who might even not exist...
Dialog_Action_990700205_103,My belly's growling!
Dialog_Action_990700205_104,Pull yourself together! Think of your favorite food and it'll give you strength!
Dialog_Action_990700205_105,Really? I'll give it a try...
Dialog_Action_990700205_106,Steak! Steak! Is it real!?
Dialog_Action_990700205_107,Ahhhh!! Outrageous!!
Dialog_Action_990700205_108,"Look at that mole, big, fat and round... Could it be the ""Nian"" who stole our food?"
Dialog_Action_990700205_109,"Can it talk? Hey, mole! Can you talk?"
Dialog_Action_990700205_110,...
Dialog_Action_990700205_111,I think you're too starving...
Dialog_Action_990700205_112,Looks like this little thing can't talk... But it must have eaten our food or else it can't be so fat!
Dialog_Action_990700205_113,What's that?!!
Dialog_Action_990700205_114,Could it be...Nian?
Dialog_Action_990700205_115,It looks quite...weird...
Dialog_Action_990700205_116,"Hey, what are you gawking at?! After it!"
Dialog_Action_990700205_117,Ah... Right...
Dialog_Action_990700210_101,It got away again!
Dialog_Action_990700210_102,We're pretty close to its den. After it!
Dialog_Action_990700210_103,Nian is quite sly!
Dialog_Action_990700210_104,"And it throws food everywhere, drawing many mutant creatures!"
Dialog_Action_990700210_105,"Sigh, its den must be very dangerous. Could we survive it?"
Dialog_Action_990700210_106,Don't worry! We'll make it. I heard Nian has a weakness. And I've prepared the secret weapon!
Dialog_Action_990700210_107,Something's wrong...
Dialog_Action_990700210_108,Damn! We're under attack!
Dialog_Action_990700210_109,Where's your secret weapon?
Dialog_Action_990700210_110,That take! Foul beast!
Dialog_Action_990700210_111,A legendary creature fears this?
Dialog_Action_990700210_112,"Wonderful, isn't it? Let's proceed. It won't sneak on us again."
Dialog_Action_800105101_101,(Whistling)
Dialog_Action_800105101_102,"I say, MacCready, what's going on with this wanted ""big monster""? It sounds fishy. Are you not worried?"
Dialog_Action_800105101_103,"Relax. As far as I know, it's a giant beast who likes hunting raiders and bandits. A little hunt adds some fun to the dull life in the vault, huh?"
Dialog_Action_800105101_104,"Wait, what do you mean by ""hunting raiders and bandits""? Where did you get his bounty quest?"
Dialog_Action_800105101_105,Of course from the raiders and bandits... They're much scared.
Dialog_Action_800105101_106,(Frown) Don't you feel a bit fishy?
Dialog_Action_800105101_107,Ha! A simple job with big money to make. Who cares more than that?! Let's go!
Dialog_Action_800105101_108,These ghouls are drawn here by the smell of the dead... Seems something bad...happened here.
Dialog_Action_800105101_109,Do you still think it's a simple hunt?
Dialog_Action_800105101_110,"Of course. The bounty said this ""giant beast"" kills raiders. I'm fully prepared."
Dialog_Action_800105101_111,"Sometimes I wish I could be as optimistic as you, MacCready."
Dialog_Action_800105101_112,These dead raiders appear to be that beast's doing.
Dialog_Action_800105101_113,They didn't stand a chance...
Dialog_Action_800105101_114,(MacCready examines the corpses of raiders) Um... Sharp claw... Brute strength...
Dialog_Action_800105101_115,What is it? A bear monster's corpse? Interesting...
Dialog_Action_800105101_116,Any findings?
Dialog_Action_800105101_117,"It's definitely not a common beast, but a sly and lethal predator!"
Dialog_Action_800105101_118,It lured the prey into this bear monster's cave and struck while they were in the middle of fight.
Dialog_Action_800105101_119,It all ended in a moment. These raiders had no time to resist.
Dialog_Action_800105101_120,So...are we in big trouble?
Dialog_Action_800105101_121,What? No. It all goes as I planned!
Dialog_Action_800105113_101,"MacCready, are you sure the ""giant beast"" is here?"
Dialog_Action_800105113_102,It's a bit...sinister...
Dialog_Action_800105113_103,Come on! It's not a big deal. Trust my tracking ability. It never went wrong.
Dialog_Action_800105113_104,Wait...
Dialog_Action_800105113_105,Hurry! We're losing it!
Dialog_Action_800105113_106,These animals seem on edge... Looks like they've been disturbed by something...
Dialog_Action_800105113_107,It means our prey is near!
Dialog_Action_800105113_108,"MacCready, we should be careful..."
Dialog_Action_800105113_109,"Wait, I heard something... The ""giant beast"" must be lurking somewhere here!"
Dialog_Action_800105113_110,What are you waiting for? Come on!
Dialog_Action_800105113_111,(Mumble)
Dialog_Action_800105113_112,"Wait, something's wrong..."
Dialog_Action_800105113_113,Ah...
Dialog_Action_800105113_114,Ha! Got it!
Dialog_Action_800105113_115,"Chief, no, it's not that guy!"
Dialog_Action_800105113_116,Huh? What do you mean?... Damn... A bunch of passing tourists? What are they doing here?
Dialog_Action_800105113_117,"No idea... Chief, what now?"
Dialog_Action_800105113_118,We can't be exposed! Rid of these idiots!
Dialog_Action_800105113_119,Yes..! Chief!
Dialog_Action_800105113_120,Well... I'm sorry...
Dialog_Action_800105113_121,Ahhhh! Here it comes! Fire!
Dialog_Action_800105113_122,Um... Wha...what happened?
Dialog_Action_800105113_123,"Wake up, humans, you were ambushed by the raiders. But now it's okay."
Dialog_Action_800105113_124,You... I can never forget your face. You're that talking deathclaw!
Dialog_Action_800105113_125,"Yes, thanks for retrieving my egg before. Allow me to introduce myself: My name is Kura, from the west coast."
Dialog_Action_800105113_126,Thanks...for saving us. Were those raiders here for you? How did you mess with them?
Dialog_Action_800105113_127,"It's a long story. After we parted, I couldn't hide myself well because I was too happy. Remnants of those egg thieves followed me and found my hideout."
Dialog_Action_800105113_128,"They were patient and hidden well. Finally, they stole my egg again while I was away for food."
Dialog_Action_800105113_129,"Then they fled to the Glowing Sea, hoping to cover their trails... And now they know I'm a special deathclaw. They want to train my baby into a lethal weapon!"
Dialog_Action_800105113_130,Sounds they're getting smarter...
Dialog_Action_800105113_131,Wait... Wait a sec... What is this? Are you friends with this... talking deathclaw?
Dialog_Action_800105113_132,"Oh, MacCready, you have much to learn. But most importantly, what about your bounty?"
Dialog_Action_800105113_133,...
Dialog_Action_800105113_134,Forget about it! Nothing is cooler than making friends with a deathclaw!
Dialog_Action_800105113_135,"Good. Kura, we'll set off again to help you get your egg back!"
Dialog_Action_800105135_101,"MacCready, are you serious? Could the den of those egg thieves be here?"
Dialog_Action_800105135_102,Come on! Can't you just believe me once? My tracking techniques are beyond your comprehension. (Whisper) Save me some face in front of our deathclaw friend...
Dialog_Action_800105135_103,He's right. I can smell them...
Dialog_Action_800105135_104,"I'll distract them head on, you stay behind me... But their boss is mine!"
Dialog_Action_800105135_105,(Roars of Kura and screams of raiders coming from afar)
Dialog_Action_800105135_106,It feels so...good knowing a deathclaw on our side...
Dialog_Action_800105135_107,"Ah! Deathclaw mom, I've been waiting for you!"
Dialog_Action_800105135_108,"As an egg thief, you're quite bold."
Dialog_Action_800105135_109,I dared steal a talking deathclaw's egg. It means I'm fully prepared.
Dialog_Action_800105135_110,Ready to be ripped apart?
Dialog_Action_800105135_111,We'll see!
Dialog_Action_800105135_112,Cough... What's this...?
Dialog_Action_800105135_113,"The famous smoke bomb, ""Illusionion""... The smoke may not hurt a strong creature like you, but it can pin you down with my little improvements."
Dialog_Action_800105135_114,"It may not last long, but long enough for me to take care of you, you blasted beast!"
Dialog_Action_800105135_115,Ready for a shot in your head?
Dialog_Action_800105135_116,Not so fast!
Dialog_Action_800105135_117,Ah! You damned...
Dialog_Action_800105135_118,"Kura, now, run!"
Dialog_Action_800105135_119,You blasted meddlers!
Dialog_Action_800105135_120,"Thank you! Thanks for saving my life, MacCready."
Dialog_Action_800105135_121,"No need to mention it! Your friend, Bounty Hunter MacCready, at your service!"
Dialog_Action_800105135_122,"Haha, you humans...always surprise me."
Dialog_Action_800105135_123,Seems these egg thieves are all done for. Should we check your egg now?
Dialog_Action_800105135_124,"Yes... Speaking of it, it should hatch soon."
Dialog_Action_800105135_125,The baby... Just born!!
Dialog_Action_800105135_126,My baby...
Dialog_Action_800105135_127,Are you crying?
Dialog_Action_800105135_128,I guess that's joyful tears you humans talk about...
Dialog_Action_800105135_129,"I have a good idea! Since we're friends, why not let this little fella live in your vault for some time? Perhaps it could learn something...interesting."
Dialog_Action_800105135_130,That's...no problem! I bet vault dwellers would be so glad to hear that!
Dialog_Action_980500100_101,"No matter how many times I've been here, I still think this is a sinister place."
Dialog_Action_980500100_102,"...And we're ""stepping right into the trap our enemies have laid""?"
Dialog_Action_980500100_103,Got it?... Buzz... Hello...
Dialog_Action_980500100_104,Who are you? Did you lead us here?
Dialog_Action_980500100_105,"Ah, yeah. Name's Kent Connery, a comic fan. I run ""the Silver Shroud"" radio and very night I play Shroud's stories to dwellers in the Commonwealth Wasteland..."
Dialog_Action_980500100_106,Cut to the chase. Why are you luring us to Hubris Comics?
Dialog_Action_980500100_107,"Sorry, it's no trap. A few days ago my radio was disturbed by strange signals. My investigation leads me to the source coming from the beneath of Hubris Comics."
Dialog_Action_980500100_108,I wonder what's hidden there. But...I'm just an old ghoul. So I sent you this signal. Hope you don't mind.
Dialog_Action_980500100_109,"(Sigh) Since we're here, might as well check what's in there!"
Dialog_Action_980500100_201,This...
Dialog_Action_980500100_202,A secret facility beneath Hubris Comics?
Dialog_Action_980500100_203,"Test program initializing... Hello, Visitor Code TS002. Welcome to the latest ""Hubris Adventure"" system. Please sit and wait to be connected to ""Hubris World""."
Dialog_Action_980500100_204,What's going on? I have no idea.
Dialog_Action_980500100_205,"Processing... Description sequence starting... ""Hubris Adventure"" is a new experimental experience system of Hubris Comics which offers deeper experience to users through a virtual reality that restores scenarios in comics."
Dialog_Action_980500100_206,Warning: This system has not been tested for quality assurance.
Dialog_Action_980500100_207,"What a find! Must be someone activated this thing by chance and it caused strange disturbance. Friends from the Vault, would you like to give it a try?"
Dialog_Action_980500100_208,Um... I heard the robot say it's not quality-assured...
Dialog_Action_980500100_209,"To hell with it! ""Hubris Adventure""! Sounds thrilling! This seat is mine!"
Dialog_Action_980500107_101,"Hey, everybody connected? It feels like Memory Dens of Boss Irma."
Dialog_Action_980500107_102,"But with defect details, problematic lighting system and the texture, humph..."
Dialog_Action_980500107_103,Don't be so picky. It's a tech way back over 200 years ago.
Dialog_Action_980500107_104,"Cough, strangers, a bad timing for you!"
Dialog_Action_980500107_105,Who goes there?
Dialog_Action_980500107_106,"The one before you: The Silver Shroud, bringer of death and speaker of justice!"
Dialog_Action_980500107_107,"Um, does he have to talk like this?"
Dialog_Action_980500107_108,"Listen, strangers, I'm hunting a bunch of vicious thugs, a group of bloodthirsty rogues! You don't look like bad people. If you have the nerves, join me!"
Dialog_Action_980500107_109,(Restrained) Well... Fine!
Dialog_Action_980500107_110,"Time is pressed! Friends, come with me! Justice shall prevail!"
Dialog_Action_980500107_201,"Chief, it's been 5 minutes. Where's the delivery?"
Dialog_Action_980500107_202,"Quiet, something's wrong..."
Dialog_Action_980500107_203,"Indeed, your sins soil the air here!"
Dialog_Action_980500107_204,Who? Who goes there?!
Dialog_Action_980500107_205,"Death has come for you, and I am its Shroud!"
Dialog_Action_980500107_206,It's the Silver Shroud! Fire! Fire!
Dialog_Action_980500107_301,That was true comic experience!
Dialog_Action_980500107_302,"What is ""comics""?... Anyway, seems we've put an end to a dark deal. But seems they have accomplices lurking here."
Dialog_Action_980500107_303,"Relax, old friend."
Dialog_Action_980500107_304,"That voice...like bright moonlight...like a nightingale whispering in within the silence! You're the Mistress of Mystery, my comrade, my love...lost."
Dialog_Action_980500107_305,"Glad to see you again, dear Shroud. Seems your sense are still sharp as always. Yet you're still so...reckless."
Dialog_Action_980500107_306,"I've been following these thugs for some time. The delivery man doing business with them is my real target. Now because of your meddling, I bet he won't show up."
Dialog_Action_980500107_307,Damn! Justice needs patience at times...
Dialog_Action_980500107_308,"Don't worry, my friend. I have my back-up plan. Heroes, come, I know what to do next."
Dialog_Action_980500107_401,"Um, I've found something strange... Why there's a countdown on my head? It looks pretty awful..."
Dialog_Action_980500107_402,"Description sequence starting... To increase the test pressure of ""Hubris Adventure"", visitors must complete the test within a time limit..."
Dialog_Action_980500107_403,Being unable to complete the test in the due time results in a failure.
Dialog_Action_980500107_404,"These thugs are sly as fox. We must catch them soon! Come on, friends, what are you waiting for?"
Dialog_Action_980500116_101,"So...the Mistress of Mystery, um... Your story is like those comics of origins or just independent titles...?"
Dialog_Action_980500116_102,I...didn't get you.
Dialog_Action_980500116_103,"Origins are those with many Montage flashbacks, telling the miserable background or psychic trauma the hero had... And stories of making costumes and items..."
Dialog_Action_980500116_104,"Heh, you guys are weird...I think we'd better stay focused on the mission!"
Dialog_Action_980500116_105,Now it sounds more like an independent one.
Dialog_Action_980500116_106,"...Attention! Listen, the goods we're tracking emit a violet-like smell... That's why I could find this place. But it seems heavily guarded. Be careful! Don't make a fuss!"
Dialog_Action_980500116_107,"Whatever you say, my lady."
Dialog_Action_980500116_201,"(Whisper) Hush... Look, it must be enemies' warehouse."
Dialog_Action_980500116_202,(Whisper) So what's in the world are we looking for?
Dialog_Action_980500116_203,"Jimmy, what the hell are we unloading? It smells pretty good."
Dialog_Action_980500116_204,How should I know? I don't care as long as I get paid.
Dialog_Action_980500116_205,"Aren't you curious? Look at us. We're just minions that are about to die. If it's common perfume we're carrying, is it really worth our lives?"
Dialog_Action_980500116_206,(Whisper) He made a point.
Dialog_Action_980500116_207,Shut your trap and do the job!
Dialog_Action_980500116_208,(Whisper) Seems they've unloaded it. Time for an ambush! Come on! Heroes!
Dialog_Action_980500116_209,Who's there? Darn it! It's the Mistress of Mystery!
Dialog_Action_980500116_210,Ahhh! I hate my stupid mouth!
Dialog_Action_980500116_301,Now let's check their goods...
Dialog_Action_980500116_302,Let me see... Um...so fragrant... Isn't it normal perfume?... It smells great... Um... Why do your noses look so big?...
Dialog_Action_980500116_303,"Damn, the perfume causes hallucinations! Cover your nose!"
Dialog_Action_980500116_304,Seems it's worth their lives. But what do they want with these hallucinating perfume?
Dialog_Action_980500116_305,Yeah... Teehee... What do...hiccup...they want?
Dialog_Action_980500116_306,"Don't worry. I've installed a positioning device on their truck. Soon the Silver Shroud should track down their factory. You'd better hurry to join him, heroes."
Dialog_Action_980500116_307,Sounds another tough fight.
Dialog_Action_980500116_401,"It's so dark here! Hey! You stepped on me, idiots!"
Dialog_Action_980500116_402,Um... Sorry...
Dialog_Action_980500116_403,"Description sequence starting... To increase the test pressure of ""Hubris Adventure"", visitors must complete this test with a limited vision."
Dialog_Action_980500116_404,Fighting in the dark is one of the basics to combat crimes. Are you ready?
Dialog_Action_980500116_405,Ready!
Dialog_Action_980500116_406,Not yet!
Dialog_Action_980500108_101,"The night provides cover. The factory of hallucinating perfume is here. No more delay for justice! Heroes, let's smash up their factory and reveal their boss!"
Dialog_Action_980500108_102,Do you remember the Mistress of Mystery told you not to be so reckless?
Dialog_Action_980500108_103,"Yeah, normally, a comic series wouldn't end so soon. It needs at least 3 or 4 twists. And I bet what we'll meet here is definitely not the real manipulator."
Dialog_Action_980500108_104,Um... A wise suggestion. Perhaps we could get more clues here and find the one behind all this.
Dialog_Action_980500108_105,"That's right, Shroud!"
Dialog_Action_980500108_201,(Whisper) The house is heavily fortified. Their boss must be here.
Dialog_Action_980500108_202,(Whisper) Let us hear their last words and see if we learn something useful.
Dialog_Action_980500108_203,"Hey, Mick, did you hear from boss? Seems super heroes are watching over us."
Dialog_Action_980500108_204,"Relax, Ralph. I heard them. Even they're here, we'll be fine."
Dialog_Action_980500108_205,Why?
Dialog_Action_980500108_206,"Because they got their so-called ""moral codes"", talking about ""cross that line and it's crime"", nonsense like that... So...don't worry!"
Dialog_Action_980500108_207,But boss said it's the Silver Shroud this time. This guy never left prisoners!
Dialog_Action_980500108_208,"What? Sheriff Dalton said it? Is that guy who says ""Death has come for you evil doer, and I am its..."""
Dialog_Action_980500108_209,Shroud!
Dialog_Action_980500108_210,"Oh shit, we're done for."
Dialog_Action_980500108_301,Unbelievable! Sheriff Dalton!
Dialog_Action_980500108_302,What? Who's that?
Dialog_Action_980500108_303,"He's the only man I trust in the Commonwealth Police Station, a good and upright cop! Why? My friend, how come you've fallen to this?"
Dialog_Action_980500108_304,"There must be something. Heroes, excuse me, I must talk to him alone!"
Dialog_Action_980500108_305,Wait...
Dialog_Action_980500117_101,"Damn, that hothead just ran into the Commonwealth Police Station alone! Could he see it's a trap?"
Dialog_Action_980500117_102,He wants to confront Sheriff Dalton in person. And he looks really hyper.
Dialog_Action_980500117_103,"So, who's this Sheriff Dalton?"
Dialog_Action_980500117_104,"Sheriff Dalton is a respectable man. Because of his presence, the Commonwealth Police Station could survive this sin city without being corrupted!"
Dialog_Action_980500117_105,(Whisper) Normally a city where heroes dwell must be filthy and infested with criminals.
Dialog_Action_980500117_106,"If even Sheriff Dalton fell, a darker force would pull the strings. I'm afraid it's dangerous for the Silver Shroud."
Dialog_Action_980500117_107,Seems we don't have much time. We must find him before he meets the sheriff!
Dialog_Action_980500117_201,(Gesture for stop) Something's over there.
Dialog_Action_980500117_202,Give it up! Shroud. Tell me where's the mysterious bitch... I may spare your life.
Dialog_Action_980500117_203,Cough...Sheriff Dalton...Why? You're not supposed to be like this!
Dialog_Action_980500117_204,Cut the crap! (Shooting)
Dialog_Action_980500117_205,Ah...
Dialog_Action_980500117_206,Stop!!!
Dialog_Action_980500117_301,"Dear, are you alright?"
Dialog_Action_980500117_302,Cough... I'm fine. Justice bringer can't be taken by death so easily...
Dialog_Action_980500117_303,"Hey, man, it's no time for these fancy lines!"
Dialog_Action_980500117_304,Look...Sheriff Dalton...
Dialog_Action_980500117_305,That hypocrite did this to you!
Dialog_Action_980500117_306,"No... No, he didn't mean it..."
Dialog_Action_980500117_307,What?!
Dialog_Action_980500117_308,"I... Where am I? The Silver Shroud and the Mistress of Mystery, what are you doing here? What happened?"
Dialog_Action_980500117_309,You punk... You...really can't remember?
Dialog_Action_980500117_310,(Sheriff Dalton stares at the Mistress of Mystery in confusion and shock)
Dialog_Action_980500117_311,Damn... He's been brainwashed! There's only one man who could do this in the entire Commonwealth!
Dialog_Action_980500117_312,Dr. Brainwash!!
Dialog_Action_980500117_313,"Oh, finally! The super villain!"
Dialog_Action_980500117_314,"I... Sorry, I have no idea what you're talking about. I didn't even know when I was brainwashed..."
Dialog_Action_980500117_315,"That's what terrible about Dr. Brainwash... Rest up, sheriff. Leave the rest to us."
Dialog_Action_980500101_101,"Mistress of Mystery, my lady, I understand Shroud's wounded and you're upset, but why do we have to infiltrate such a heavily guarded military base?!"
Dialog_Action_980500101_102,"Yeah, it seems it has nothing to do with Dr. Brainwash."
Dialog_Action_980500101_103,Dr. Brainwash is very cunning and he never reveals himself. Our only lead is the hallucinating perfume we captured.
Dialog_Action_980500101_104,"But my technologies can't trace back to him. So we need ""borrow"" some military chemical position indicators from the military base."
Dialog_Action_980500101_105,Easier said than done. It's must be a one-way trip!
Dialog_Action_980500101_106,Don't worry! We'll get in through the sewers.
Dialog_Action_980500101_107,I hate sewers!
Dialog_Action_980500101_201,There's the warehouse. Guards look tough to deal with.
Dialog_Action_980500101_202,"Mistress of Mystery, a battle-hardened hero like you must have many secret weapons!"
Dialog_Action_980500101_203,Let me see... Here. The Phantom Device...which can create a confusing fog.
Dialog_Action_980500101_204,I guess we'll get confused too...
Dialog_Action_980500101_205,"And the Sound of Silence, a pistol that shoots electromagnetic bullets."
Dialog_Action_980500101_206,I don't think a pistol could deal with guards of such level.
Dialog_Action_980500101_207,I got Buster Sword too.
Dialog_Action_980500101_208,What's that? Anything special?
Dialog_Action_980500101_209,"No, just a sword. Let's go!"
Dialog_Action_980500101_210,Huh?
Dialog_Action_980500101_301,Unbelievable! Defeated the guards with a simple sword!
Dialog_Action_980500101_302,Not a big deal. Let's see what we could find!
Dialog_Action_980500101_303,Here... The briefcase looks important.
Dialog_Action_980500101_304,Let me see... (The Mistress of Mystery opens a seemingly important briefcase.)
Dialog_Action_980500101_305,What?! Smell of violet... It's...highly-concentrated hallucinating perfume!
Dialog_Action_980500101_306,(Broadcast) Hahahaha! You knew I'd be waiting for you? Mistress of Mystery! Welcome to my legion!
Dialog_Action_980500101_307,Urrgh... Damn!
Dialog_Action_980500101_308,The typical laugh! Could it be...?
Dialog_Action_980500101_309,(Broadcast) That's right. I'm the one you're looking for: Doctor...Brainwash!
Dialog_Action_980500101_310,"Hurry... Get out of here, heroes! Before you get controlled!"
Dialog_Action_980500101_311,What a twist! That's more like it!
Dialog_Action_980500101_312,Move your ass and let's go!
Dialog_Action_980500102_101,"Run, heroes! We must find the Mistress of Mystery before she is controlled by Dr. Brainwash! Eh... (The Silver Shroud twitched in pain)."
Dialog_Action_980500102_102,"Easy, Mr. Shroud, you're not recovered."
Dialog_Action_980500102_103,"(Whisper) I say, the story requires super heroes to be injured... And it doesn't change the story no matter how seriously they're wounded... So you don't have to be so concerned..."
Dialog_Action_980500102_104,(Whisper) Hush! I'm just playing along! (Turn to the Silver Shroud) Let's go! To the den of Dr. Brainwash!
Dialog_Action_980500102_105,But how can we find out where Dr. Brainwash is hiding? We've lost our only lead and the Mistress of Mystery has been caught too...
Dialog_Action_980500102_106,"I... When we were still lovers, I installed a small positioning device in her ring. Never thought it'd work one day."
Dialog_Action_980500102_107,What? You did that to your ex-girlfriend?
Dialog_Action_980500102_108,"(Whisper) Hush! What did I say? Play along! Immersion! (Turn to the Silver Shroud) Cough, it's okay. Let's go!"
Dialog_Action_980500102_201,"Tread lightly, pals. I smell something fishy. Dr. Brainwash's evil den should not be far."
Dialog_Action_980500102_202,You're right this time. I smell it too. Violet again. This room must be a trap.
Dialog_Action_980500102_203,What next?
Dialog_Action_980500102_204,Trigger the trap!
Dialog_Action_980500102_205,"(Slow applause and sinister sneer from the broadcast) Humph, welcome!"
Dialog_Action_980500102_206,"(Slow applause and sinister sneer from the broadcast) Humph, welcome!"
Dialog_Action_980500102_207,"(Broadcast) The Silver Shroud! I've heard a lot about you! I bet you must be here to save your old lover, the Mistress of Mystery!"
Dialog_Action_980500102_208,Dr. Brainwash! You coward! Come and meet justice!
Dialog_Action_980500102_209,"(Broadcast) Oh, come on! Why should a decent doctor like me come all the way here facing a madman with a rifle? You'd better play with my loyal servants!"
Dialog_Action_980500102_301,"Um... Seems you're worthy of your reputation, Shroud. You deserve to be rewarded."
Dialog_Action_980500102_302,(Broadcast) Your old lover is yours now!
Dialog_Action_980500102_303,Totally a trap.
Dialog_Action_980500102_304,"Dear, are you alright?"
Dialog_Action_980500102_305,...
Dialog_Action_980500102_306,I have a bad feeling about this...
Dialog_Action_980500102_307,"(Broadcast) Sorry, she's my servant now... So are you!"
Dialog_Action_980500102_308,Urrgh... It's hallucinating perfume...
Dialog_Action_980500104_101,"Eh, where are we?"
Dialog_Action_980500104_102,We must be affected by Dr. Brainwash's hallucinating perfume and enter...an...illusionary space...
Dialog_Action_980500104_103,You mean we're in the virtual reality of Hubris Comics and we got affected by illusions... Now we're in the virtual reality of that virtual reality?
Dialog_Action_980500104_104,Almost correct!
Dialog_Action_980500104_105,Wow! That's... How do we get out of here?
Dialog_Action_980500104_106,Leave it to me!
Dialog_Action_980500104_107,Mistress of Mystery! I thought you were brainwashed! How did you resist the gas?
Dialog_Action_980500104_108,"My Veil of Mystery could defend any venomous gas. Girls keep their own secrets, huh?"
Dialog_Action_980500104_109,So you were just pretending?
Dialog_Action_980500104_110,"Of course, Dr. Brainwash is always ahead of us. He wouldn't make a mistake unless he thought he won."
Dialog_Action_980500104_111,Then we can defeat the enemy from the internal!
Dialog_Action_980500104_112,"Right. When you were distracting him, I found a way to neutralize the gas. Once we find the Silver Shroud, I can take you all back to reality."
Dialog_Action_980500104_201,I heard the Silver Shroud.
Dialog_Action_980500104_202,(The Silver Shroud's voice from a distance) Hideous monsters! Take that!
Dialog_Action_980500104_203,It sounds he's fighting those illusionary enemies!
Dialog_Action_980500104_204,Or perhaps it's just my delusion.
Dialog_Action_980500104_205,"Anyway, we must press ahead to break it! Let's go!"
Dialog_Action_980500104_301,The Silver Shroud's not here. But I kinda hear him...
Dialog_Action_980500104_302,"(The Silver Shroud's voice from a distance) Endless. But you really think you can defeat justice? Death has come for you, and I am its Shroud!"
Dialog_Action_980500104_303,He sounds quite energetic...as always.
Dialog_Action_980500104_304,That's right! Shroud has gone through extremely harsh training. The hallucinating perfume works not so well on him. Seems our old friend has been out of the phantasm.
Dialog_Action_980500104_305,"Here, down the neutralizer, you'll be free of hallucinating perfume! Let's join Shroud and put an end to Dr. Brainwash's crimes!"
Dialog_Action_980500104_306,"Wait a sec... How could we drink a bottle of neutralizer in a virtual reality? Ah, never mind..."
Dialog_Action_980500105_101,"Heroes, Mistress of Mystery! Glad to see you're back. Seems Dr. Brainwash has finally exposed his weakness."
Dialog_Action_980500105_102,And we're right in his real den!
Dialog_Action_980500105_103,How thrilling. Finally a real challenge?
Dialog_Action_980500105_104,"Dr. Brainwash, you're watching, aren't you?! You can't run. Justice shall be served!"
Dialog_Action_980500105_105,"(Sighs from the broadcast) Very well, seems the hallucinating perfume didn't work well. I gotta fire that idiot who came up with the idea."
Dialog_Action_980500105_106,Hey! Steve! You're fired! (Shooting and scream from the broadcast)
Dialog_Action_980500105_107,I start to like this guy.
Dialog_Action_980500105_108,"(Broadcast) Enough, come to me. Let's end this once for all!"
Dialog_Action_980500105_201,"(Sigh) Quite stubborn, aren't you?!"
Dialog_Action_980500105_202,"Justice never stops! Your evil deeds end here, Dr. Brainwash!"
Dialog_Action_980500105_203,(Broadcast) Can't you say something new?
Dialog_Action_980500105_204,"Your plan is over whatever you're up to, Dr. Brainwash!"
Dialog_Action_980500105_205,(Broadcast) That sounds better. But do your tiny brains really understand my grand design?
Dialog_Action_980500105_206,Why not tell us?
Dialog_Action_980500105_207,(Broadcast) Ha! Every step you take goes as I planned.
Dialog_Action_980500105_208,"Huh! All villains love this line. Actually you have no idea, right?"
Dialog_Action_980500105_209,"(Broadcast) Huh! Really think a few boxes of perfume is my plan? If it weren't for... Damn, nearly spilled the beans! You might as well play with my minions!"
Dialog_Action_980500105_301,"Finally, Dr. Brainwash."
Dialog_Action_980500105_302,"It's an honor to meet you. I gotta admit, Mistress of Mystery, you look better than in the video."
Dialog_Action_980500105_303,"Eh, this guy is pretty sick."
Dialog_Action_980500105_304,"Here ends your pathetic crimes, Doctor. Death has come for you evil doer, and I am its..."
Dialog_Action_980500105_305,"Shroud, right? Honestly, you should change that line..."
Dialog_Action_980500105_306,"(Shroud pulled the trigger and gunshots were loud. But when the smoke dispersed and all fell silent, it was Dr. Brainwash's holographic image he hit.)"
Dialog_Action_980500105_307,What?!
Dialog_Action_980500105_308,"Sorry, I'm in the middle of things, see...you...later!"
Dialog_Action_980500105_309,Curses!! I feel he's always toying with us!
Dialog_Action_980500105_310,What now?
Dialog_Action_980500105_311,Guess it's time to rally my old friends.
Dialog_Action_980500105_312,Oh! Now this sounds like a sequel of assembling heroes!
Dialog_Action_980500105_401,(Broadcast) Are you still here? (Sigh) How stubborn.
Dialog_Action_980500105_402,"Justice never stops! Your evil deeds end here, Dr. Brainwash!"
Dialog_Action_980500105_403,(Broadcast) Can't you say something new?
Dialog_Action_980500105_404,"Your scheme is over no matter what you're up to, Dr. Brainwash!"
Dialog_Action_980500105_405,"(Broadcast) No, no, no, your tiny brains will never understand my grand design!"
Dialog_Action_980500105_406,"(Broadcast) Robot servants, finish them!"
Dialog_Action_980500105_501,Damn! Dr. Brainwash! How many did you manipulate with the perfume?
Dialog_Action_980500105_502,"(Broadcast) Hey, stop it. They're willing to serve me. Am I right, boys?"
Dialog_Action_980500105_503,Yeah! Doctor is so nice!
Dialog_Action_980500105_504,Yeah! Doctor said he has no friends. He almost cried when we agreed to be his friends.
Dialog_Action_980500105_505,(Broadcast) Shut up! Tom!
Dialog_Action_980500105_506,"Keep going, Tom."
Dialog_Action_980500105_507,And...Doctor said he invented the hallucinating perfume because he hoped more people would like him!
Dialog_Action_980500105_508,"Yeah! Doctor is actually a good ""badass!"""
Dialog_Action_980500105_509,"(Sighs from the broadcast) I've changed my mind... Mistress of Mystery, Shroud, do me a favor and get rid of these dimwits!"
Dialog_Action_980500103_101,Uh... My head hurts. Where are we?
Dialog_Action_980500103_102,Aren't we supposed to be at Hubris Comics? But it doesn't look like a comics press here...
Dialog_Action_980500103_103,Buzz... Buzz.... Hello? Anyone?
Dialog_Action_980500103_104,"Kent, what did you do? We were transferred to a building out of the blue! And it's collapsing!"
Dialog_Action_980500103_105,"Tssss... Trust me, I don't know what happened either. Your radio signal was suspended for long..."
Dialog_Action_980500103_106,"Buzz... I'll try to connect to Hubris Overseer Robot, it should know what's going on."
Dialog_Action_980500103_107,(Radio) Detecting Visitor Code TS002 off test sequence... System diagnosing...
Dialog_Action_980500103_108,"""System diagnosing...""?? You broken robot better hurry!"
Dialog_Action_980500103_109,(Radio) ...System diagnosis: Continuing test requires extra Hubris holographic data. Visitor Code TS002 has been teleported to nearby Hubris holotapes.
Dialog_Action_980500103_110,(Radio) Teleportation shall be activated again after Visitor Code TS002 obtains holotapes.
Dialog_Action_980500103_111,"Oh, this is totally crap!"
Dialog_Action_980500103_201,The house's collapsing!
Dialog_Action_980500103_202,(Radio) Diagnosing...
Dialog_Action_980500103_203,"Ah, I've had it enough with this broken robot invented 200 years ago!"
Dialog_Action_980500103_204,(Radio) Diagnosing...
Dialog_Action_980500103_205,"Here, got it. Hubris Comics' holotapes. Damn you broken robot. Get us out of here!"
Dialog_Action_980500103_206,"(Radio) Visitor Code TS002, please move to the evacuation spot."
Dialog_Action_980500103_301,"(Radio) Teleportation activating, calibrating, Visitor TS001 please stays still."
Dialog_Action_980500103_302,This is too much!
Dialog_Action_980500103_303,(Radio) Calibrating... Teleportation countdown activating...
Dialog_Action_980500103_304,"(Radio) 10, 9, 8..."
Dialog_Action_980500103_305,Can't you start from 3?!
Dialog_Action_980500106_101,Test sequence suspended. Warning: Detecting...external threats. Visitor Code TS002 has been teleported to safe zone.
Dialog_Action_980500106_102,"Hey, what's going on? I was on the roll!"
Dialog_Action_980500106_103,"Kent, any idea? Kent?"
Dialog_Action_980500106_104,Seems our signal was disturbed. We must find that Overseer Robot and check it out before proceeding with the comic world adventure.
Dialog_Action_980500106_105,How troublesome.
Dialog_Action_980500106_201,"(Radio) Warning, warning... Detecting Visitor Code TS001... Authorization error... Error..."
Dialog_Action_980500106_202,Visitor Code TS001? I recall our code is TS002.
Dialog_Action_980500106_203,Code TS001 must be the first person who activated Hubris basement. Who could it be?!
Dialog_Action_980500106_204,I sense something fishy...
Dialog_Action_980500106_205,You talk more like the Silver Shroud...
Dialog_Action_980500106_301,"(Radio) Warning, warning, warning..."
Dialog_Action_980500106_302,How come I feel so good hearing Overseer Robot gets his ass kicked...
Dialog_Action_980500106_303,"Although it's a god damn broken robot, we might as well save it. Because that's what heroes do."
Dialog_Action_980500106_304,"You're too involved, bro!"
Dialog_Action_980500106_305,Seems this robot is the troublemaker.
Dialog_Action_980500106_306,Ready? Super heroes?
Dialog_Action_980500106_307,"Of course! Death has come for you, robot, and I am its Shroud!"
Dialog_Action_980500106_401,Threat neutralized. Test sequence rebooting... Complete.
Dialog_Action_980500106_402,"Overseer, any info about Visitor Code TS001?"
Dialog_Action_980500106_403,"Searching...error, Visitor Code TS001, failed to collect info."
Dialog_Action_980500106_404,"Who could this ""Code TS001"" be? I feel we're being watched."
Dialog_Action_980500106_405,...Hello? Anyone? There was a big disturbance again. What happened?
Dialog_Action_980500106_406,"It's okay, Kent. Now I just want to play the sequel of Hubris Adventure!"
Dialog_Action_980500126_101,"(Radio) Welcome, Visitor Code TS002. Description sequence initiating..."
Dialog_Action_980500126_102,Ah... Feels familiar. This familiar broken robot.
Dialog_Action_980500126_103,(Radio) Please...eliminate invaders in Hubris Comics to ensure...test security.
Dialog_Action_980500126_104,"Why we encounter weird ""invaders"" every time we came here? What's the charm of this hell?"
Dialog_Action_980500126_105,"Guess they really like the comics here. Speaking of it, where's Kent, that comic fan? We've lost his contact since we came here..."
Dialog_Action_980500126_106,Weirdo. Leave him alone. I got comics to watch!
Dialog_Action_980500126_201,"Threat eliminated, loading data..."
Dialog_Action_980500126_202,Take it easy.
Dialog_Action_980500126_203,"Test sequence corrected, decoding new data... Success."
Dialog_Action_980500126_204,Can I get a cup of coffee?
Dialog_Action_980500126_205,"Searching data Manta Man: Return...error, data contaminated."
Dialog_Action_980500126_206,What?
Dialog_Action_980500126_207,"Visitor Code TS002 please connect to ""Hubris Adventure"" test contamination zone, provide test data for fixing."
Dialog_Action_980500126_208,Sounds no good!
Dialog_Action_980500126_209,No good? The broken robot's gonna destroy us!
Dialog_Action_980500126_210,"Connection is about to start. Visitor Code TS002, please get prepared."
Dialog_Action_980500127_101,"Eh, my head hurts."
Dialog_Action_980500127_102,What happened? It's suspended again?
Dialog_Action_980500127_103,"(Radio) Data severely contaminated, unable to continue test. Visitor Code TS002, please gather more data on Manta Man: Returns."
Dialog_Action_980500127_104,(Radio) Visitor Code TS002 has been teleported to nearby signal source.
Dialog_Action_980500127_105,"Hey, I'm here to watch comics. Why a ""visitor"" like us should help you investigate such data contamination?"
Dialog_Action_980500127_106,"(Radio) Description sequence launching... 'Manta Man: Returns' holotape data was collected 5 days ago, sender...Visitor...Code TS001."
Dialog_Action_980500127_107,What? TS001? Who is this guy? It's getting nowhere.
Dialog_Action_980500127_108,"(Radio) Explaining: To get more data on TS001, test of 'Manta Man: Returns' must be completed. To complete it, more information must be gathered from signal's source."
Dialog_Action_980500127_109,The broken robot is a nuisance as always.
Dialog_Action_980500127_201,But we should investigate this TS001. I think every move we make at Hubris Comics has something to do with this guy.
Dialog_Action_980500127_202,"Look, I've found a holotape. Could it be the ""data"" the robot talking about?"
Dialog_Action_980500127_203,"No matter what, we should listen to it first."
Dialog_Action_980500127_204,"Buzz... Beep... Manta Man' sales are going down, only two books were sold... The hero may not be that popular, but it shouldn't be so bad..."
Dialog_Action_980500127_205,Sounds like recordings of Hubris staff... Does it really have anything to do with our mission?
Dialog_Action_980500127_206,"Hush, listen up."
Dialog_Action_980500127_207,Our best scriptwriter Tina Hopkins has been busy with the Mistress of Mystery and the new writer we hired is an idiot... Manta Man: Shrimpon?? Seriously?
Dialog_Action_980500127_208,"From tomorrow I'll write Manta Man series myself. Gotta start it all over... As for the name, I'll just call it Manta Man: Returns..."
Dialog_Action_980500127_209,You got it? I have no idea.
Dialog_Action_980500127_210,"(Radio) Manta Man: Returns, data updated. Visitor Code TS002, please return to test environment."
Dialog_Action_980500127_211,Seems these puzzles can only be solved after we complete Manta Man.
Dialog_Action_980500128_101,Eh... Um...suspended again. What's it this time?
Dialog_Action_980500128_102,Looks you've got used to the teleportation. I still feel a bit sick.
Dialog_Action_980500128_103,"(Radio) Data severely contaminated, unable..."
Dialog_Action_980500128_104,"Yeah yeah yeah, severely contaminated, requires more info. Get it done quickly and I'll still waiting for the next episode."
Dialog_Action_980500128_105,"I mean, why are you so mad with a robot?"
Dialog_Action_980500128_106,"I still can't bear this trash from two hundred years ago. (Adjusted wave frequency) Kent, are you listening? You're familiar with Hubris. Anything we could do to improve this robot?"
Dialog_Action_980500128_107,Kent? Kent?!
Dialog_Action_980500128_108,Have you noticed?... Kent has lost contact for quite some time...
Dialog_Action_980500128_109,How strange. Where did he go?
Dialog_Action_980500128_201,"Hey, Taylor, what on earth are we waiting for?"
Dialog_Action_980500128_202,"I don't know, Jack. The mysterious guy in the radio told me there would be a bunch of guys passing here with many caps."
Dialog_Action_980500128_203,Did he mean those guys behind you?
Dialog_Action_980500128_204,Probably. Let's rob them!
Dialog_Action_980500128_205,"But... Taylor, they look well-armed."
Dialog_Action_980500128_206,Right. Let's do it!
Dialog_Action_980500128_207,"But... Taylor, they look tough..."
Dialog_Action_980500128_208,Yeah. Let's get them!
Dialog_Action_980500128_209,But... Alright! Let's go!
Dialog_Action_980500128_210,That saves much energy...
Dialog_Action_980500128_301,"Look, this idiot got a holotape. Could it be the data?"
Dialog_Action_980500128_302,Something's wrong. It's quite a coincidence...
Dialog_Action_980500128_303,"Anyway, let's hear it out."
Dialog_Action_980500128_304,Buzz... Beep... Sales of Manta Man: Return don't look good. Seems the restart did not attract many readers.
Dialog_Action_980500128_305,"Just a year ago, Manta Man was one of our pillars. I don't get it why it ended up like this... If it wasn't adjusted, even the sales of the Unstoppable Alliance would be affected..."
Dialog_Action_980500128_306,"Next week the marketing department will do another big promotion. If it still doesn't sell, I guess we need to shut Manta Man down. Sorry, Manta Man is one of my favorites..."
Dialog_Action_980500128_307,Those work recordings again... What's the hidden message anyway?
Dialog_Action_980500128_308,"(Radio) Manta Man: Return, data updated, Visitor Code TS002 please return to the test environment."
Dialog_Action_980500128_309,Let's go. No more clues to be found here.
Dialog_Action_980500128_310,"Um... No, didn't we forget something? Where's Kent?"
Dialog_Action_980500128_311,Leave him be. I just want start the next test.
Dialog_Action_980500129_101,"(Radio) Data severely contaminated, unable to proceed with the test. Visitor Code TS002, please collect..."
Dialog_Action_980500129_102,"Cough... You damned broken...robot, look what you've got us into..."
Dialog_Action_980500129_103,Cough... The mist... I can't breathe... No... I think...it's a trap!
Dialog_Action_980500129_104,We gotta get out of here!
Dialog_Action_980500129_105,(Radio) Please gather more information about Manta Man: Returns...
Dialog_Action_980500129_106,Stop mentioning...cough...that god-damn info!
Dialog_Action_980500129_107,Calm down... There must be a...terrible scheme...behind this. We can't lose this only lead...
Dialog_Action_980500129_108,We...can't hold...much longer...
Dialog_Action_980500129_201,I don't...think I'll make it...
Dialog_Action_980500129_202,Hang in there... If we could make it out this time... I'd treat you with a week's mirelurk cake...
Dialog_Action_980500129_203,Ha... Cough... That's a bad joke...
Dialog_Action_980500129_204,"I'm not joking! Look, with this key, we might get of out this hell pit... Speaking of it, why...does the mist smell like violet...?"
Dialog_Action_980500129_205,What...what are you talking about? Violet?
Dialog_Action_980500129_301,Move...cough... Out of my way!
Dialog_Action_980500129_302,Curses... The guy in the radio...cough...lied to us...
Dialog_Action_980500129_303,Out...of my way...
Dialog_Action_980500129_304,Cough...cough...the violet smell...eh...
Dialog_Action_980500129_305,Have to admit...cough...it smells good...
Dialog_Action_980500129_401,I think...cough...we might find a holotape on them...
Dialog_Action_980500129_402,You're right... So you're gonna listen to it while we're suffocating?
Dialog_Action_980500129_403,Allow...me...
Dialog_Action_980500129_404,Buzz... Beep... I really don't get it... As soon as we shut down Manta Man it becomes popular and prices are skyrocketing.
Dialog_Action_980500129_405,Is it curiosity or a trap of consumerism? Anyway it's quite confusing...
Dialog_Action_980500129_406,Tina just passed by my office and told me to auction Manta Man' holotapes... She was very persuasive...
Dialog_Action_980500129_407,"Anyway, next week I'll reprint Manta Man: Return. Hopefully the hero from the depths would show his interest again..."
Dialog_Action_980500129_408,I'm kinda...cough...getting it...
Dialog_Action_980500129_409,Save your breath! Let's get out of here!
Dialog_Action_980500130_101,"(Radio) Data severely contaminated, unable to proceed..."
Dialog_Action_980500130_102,Can't the damn robot just skip this part?
Dialog_Action_980500130_103,"Quiet, look, something's wrong."
Dialog_Action_980500130_104,"Um... In this case, seems I'm a dead meat."
Dialog_Action_980500130_105,Fear not! Here comes the reinforcements!
Dialog_Action_980500130_201,Thanks for your timely rescue.
Dialog_Action_980500130_202,"Lady Irma, what are you doing here alone?"
Dialog_Action_980500130_203,I'm looking for Kent. A month ago he was in a hurry and handed me a holotape. He asked me to keep it safe and he went missing.
Dialog_Action_980500130_204,"What? Kent went missing a month ago? But we've been in touch with him for all this time...until yesterday... Wait a sec, unless..."
Dialog_Action_980500130_205,Unless it wasn't Kent who guided us to Hubris??
Dialog_Action_980500130_206,Sounds fishy. I got a message today from the radio saying Kent is here. That's why I came.
Dialog_Action_980500130_207,"Lady Irma, do you have that tape with you?"
Dialog_Action_980500130_208,"Yes, let's hear it out. Perhaps we can find get clues?"
Dialog_Action_980500130_209,Buzz... Beep... All is lost. What could a comic press do in such devastating catastrophe?
Dialog_Action_980500130_210,"All super heroes and villains we created, everything...is but a dream that allows people to live in imagination and deprives them of things important."
Dialog_Action_980500130_211,I never thought I'd escape death being that the print shop for Manta Man is so far from urban areas. But my days are numbered... My body is decaying due to the radiation...
Dialog_Action_980500130_212,So long... The world doesn't need Hubris anymore.
Dialog_Action_980500130_213,Sounds like last words from 200 years ago.
Dialog_Action_980500130_214,But it's all connected... Trust me. We'll find the answer soon.
Dialog_Action_980500131_101,Cough...cough... It's the suffocating fog again...
Dialog_Action_980500131_102,Didn't you just say...we'd find the answer soon? What's it all about with...the fog?
Dialog_Action_980500131_103,Cough... Do you smell...cough...violet? Doesn't it smell familiar?
Dialog_Action_980500131_104,You mean?!
Dialog_Action_980500131_105,"Right...the...cough...""fog"" is not from our world, but from ""Hubris Adventure""!"
Dialog_Action_980500131_106,Dr. Brainwash's hallucinating perfume... You mean someone brought the comic stuff into reality?
Dialog_Action_980500131_107,"Yes, and every time after Overseer Robot teleported us... This man...cough...knows our location...cough..."
Dialog_Action_980500131_108,Save the questions for later! We gotta get out now!
Dialog_Action_980500131_201,Cough... That...cursed...ghoul...
Dialog_Action_980500131_202,Cough... We're...fooled...
Dialog_Action_980500131_203,Ghoul? Are they talking about Kent?
Dialog_Action_980500131_204,Unlikely. But we're very close to the answer. But we have to clear the way first.
Dialog_Action_980500131_301,"Look, a holotape! This must be the last one!"
Dialog_Action_980500131_302,How do you know?
Dialog_Action_980500131_303,Because the story is about to end.
Dialog_Action_980500131_304,Buzz... Beep... I'm still alive...
Dialog_Action_980500131_305,"My body went through a lot of weird changes... But I've survived after all. According to other survivors: I've become a ""ghoul""."
Dialog_Action_980500131_306,I don't know if it's luck or misfortune. But I'm but a walking corpse who barely lives...
Dialog_Action_980500131_307,I need a reason to live... Perhaps...I can find a new goal in this lost world of Hubris...
Dialog_Action_980500131_308,"This guy must be the key. If I'm right, he is Code TS001. We can only solve all puzzles after we find him."
Dialog_Action_980500131_309,But how?
Dialog_Action_980500131_310,I think we're just a step away from him... But he knows our actions.
Dialog_Action_980500131_311,What's his purpose?!
Dialog_Action_980500131_312,No idea... Cough... But now it seems he wants us to finish the story of Manta Man...
Dialog_Action_980500132_101,Why were we teleported again? All the holotapes related to Manta Man must have been collected.
Dialog_Action_980500132_102,Ah... Glad you found out. It's a little upgrade I did for Overseer Robot.
Dialog_Action_980500132_103,"(Radio) Description sequence launching: After collecting enough data on Manta Man: Returns, the analysis of Visitor Code TS001 has new findings."
Dialog_Action_980500132_104,"(Radio) Overseer upgraded. When TS001's abnormal behavior is detected, Visitor Code TS002 shall be teleported to TS001 immediately."
Dialog_Action_980500132_105,Now it's our turn to be the hunters.
Dialog_Action_980500132_201,"Wait, where's the ghoul we're looking for?"
Dialog_Action_980500132_202,I think we've caught up with TS001!
Dialog_Action_980500132_203,"Anyway, let's finish off this guy first!"
Dialog_Action_980500132_301,Well done. I knew I was right about you.
Dialog_Action_980500132_302,Kent?!
Dialog_Action_980500132_303,"No, he's not Kent. You must be TS001! What's your purpose anyway?"
Dialog_Action_980500132_304,I suppose you've finished all holotapes I left. Now you know I used to be a walking flesh without a purpose.
Dialog_Action_980500132_305,"After so many years, I've found a new goal. But sorry, I can't tell you about it easily."
Dialog_Action_980500132_306,"Damn, stop beating around the bush! Where's Kent?"
Dialog_Action_980500132_307,"Kent's fine. After all, he's a loyal fan to Hubris Comics. I just...need him to do me a favor...just like I need your help too."
Dialog_Action_980500132_308,You wish!
Dialog_Action_980500132_309,"But you've helped much... In fact, you're helping me right now..."
Dialog_Action_980500132_310,(Radio) Warning...warning...external menace...detected...
Dialog_Action_980500132_311,"Oh crap, it's a diversion..."
Dialog_Action_980500132_312,"Precisely. Since you've helped me a lot, allow me to introduce myself again."
Dialog_Action_980500132_313,"My name's Peter Sharna, used to be the publishing director of Hubris Comics, the Code TS001 you're talking about. Glad to meet you, Vault dwellers."
Dialog_Action_980500133_101,"Damn, never thought we'd be fooled so easily!"
Dialog_Action_980500133_102,"If we couldn't find the broken robot, he would do things more terrible."
Dialog_Action_980500133_103,"You're right... We were too concentrated on ""Hubris Adventure"". But Peter got every move we made!"
Dialog_Action_980500133_104,How long has he been planning this? Even by now we don't know his purpose!
Dialog_Action_980500133_105,"Calm down. First thing first, we must get back Overseer Robot."
Dialog_Action_980500133_201,"Move along, you idiots. No time to play!"
Dialog_Action_980500133_202,"Wait, they look weird."
Dialog_Action_980500133_203,Eh... Urgh...
Dialog_Action_980500133_204,...Death...to intruders!
Dialog_Action_980500133_205,Have they been brainwashed?
Dialog_Action_980500133_206,"It must be Peter's doing. Seems finally he has made his own ""hallucinating perfume""!"
Dialog_Action_980500133_207,...Uh... Death...
Dialog_Action_980500133_301,Oh my...
Dialog_Action_980500133_302,I can't believe my eyes!
Dialog_Action_980500133_303,"Death has come for you evil doer...and I, I, I am its...Sh...Sh...Shroud!"
Dialog_Action_980500133_304,Is this a part of Peter's plan? What is he gonna do with such thing?
Dialog_Action_980500133_305,"Listen, let's tear down this broken thing before learning about his plan!"
Dialog_Action_980500133_306,"Threat eliminated, test sequence rebooting... Complete."
Dialog_Action_980500133_307,So close.
Dialog_Action_980500133_308,It's not over yet. I thought we were close to the truth. But actually we are still being toyed with.
Dialog_Action_980500133_309,And he holds Kent captive now. What should we do?
Dialog_Action_980500133_310,"Perhaps only the test of ""Hubris Adventure"" could lead us to the final answer."
Dialog_Action_980500150_101,"Wow, I didn't expect that one day we could actually come to the underwater world in the comics!"
Dialog_Action_980500150_102,"Too... impressive... you know, we may be done for in a minute of swimming in the radiant water of the Commonwealth. And now... even though this is just a virtual comic world..."
Dialog_Action_980500150_103,"Heroes, welcome to the Depths!"
Dialog_Action_980500150_104,"Dr. Brainwash is very cunning. In order to defeat him, we must summon our former partners and reorganize the ""Unstoppable Alliance."""
Dialog_Action_980500150_105,The first guy we are looking for is the King of the Depths-- Manta Man!
Dialog_Action_980500150_106,So what's so great about this Manta Man?
Dialog_Action_980500150_107,"Yeah, although he's well-known, I have no idea what on earth he's got..."
Dialog_Action_980500150_108,"About that... Well... Basically, he has the power of the Depths and can sting the enemy like a manta... And he can talk to all the marine creatures!"
Dialog_Action_980500150_109,Like talk to fish?
Dialog_Action_980500150_110,That's what it means. Let's hit the road! the Unstoppable Alliance of justice needs Manta Man!
Dialog_Action_980500150_201,Huff... Huff... Why am I feeling so tired from only a few steps?!
Dialog_Action_980500150_202,"Probably because of the high water pressure in the Depths? No, at the end of the day, this is just a virtual comic world. Getting tired from walking just doesn't make sense..."
Dialog_Action_980500150_203,"Activating Instruction Sequence: Visitor Code TS002. Please note, due to the data contamination of ""Manta Man: Returns, "" it is necessary to access TS002's brainwave data to force error correction for the test."
Dialog_Action_980500150_204,"Error correction behavior may cause brain hypoxia of TS002, so please pay attention to the ""oxygen value"" in the test from time to time."
Dialog_Action_980500150_205,"When TS002's ""oxygen value"" is depleted, the test will automatically shut down in case TS002 should suffer shock from lack of oxygen."
Dialog_Action_980500150_206,This does not sound safe at all!
Dialog_Action_980500150_301,"Ah, welcome! Heroes, the news of your arrival has flowed into my ears along the ocean current. So? Do you feel captivated in my Depths Kingdom?"
Dialog_Action_980500150_302,"Uh, speaking of which... the marine life taking orders from you don't seem to welcome us very much..."
Dialog_Action_980500150_303,"(Laughs) Isn't that a good joke? Foreigners, dwellers of the Depths are always known for their hospitality!"
Dialog_Action_980500150_304,We really mean it...
Dialog_Action_980500150_305,What? I'll look into that!
Dialog_Action_980500150_306,"Boris, my dear brother, some out-of-towners told me that something's wrong with the dwellers of the Depths... Woah. Woah. What the hell is this?"
Dialog_Action_980500150_307,Don't call me by that name anymore. Address me with the Abyssal Overlord!
Dialog_Action_980500150_308,"Your ""dear brother"" will no longer take orders from you, Manta Man."
Dialog_Action_980500150_309,"Boris, what the hell are you doing? What's with that strange bald? Why are you wearing this weird helmet?"
Dialog_Action_980500150_310,"This is the Crown of the Depths! ! And I am the Abyssal Overlord, you ignorant idiot! Shrimpon, finish my stupid brother!"
Dialog_Action_980500150_311,"Yes, yes, that's it! Abyssal Overlord, hummm-hahahaha!"
Dialog_Action_980500150_401,"Not a good time, I guess?"
Dialog_Action_980500150_402,My brother... Boris... and that bald doctor...
Dialog_Action_980500150_403,Has Dr. Brainwash been here? That dirty dog!
Dialog_Action_980500150_404,(Murmurs) Brain... Brainwash?
Dialog_Action_980500150_405,"Manta Man, calm down! You are a superhero. Is there any way we can deal with the Abyssal Overlord and Dr. Brainwash behind him?"
Dialog_Action_980500150_406,"But... But, it looks like Bo... the Abyssal Overlord has controlled all the Depths inhabitants and created some strange beings... I... I..."
Dialog_Action_980500150_407,It seems we are in trouble. Manta Man has taken a heavy blow. This guy needs to regain his confidence.
Dialog_Action_980500150_408,Must help Manta regain control of the Depths before reorganizing the Unstoppable Alliance.
Dialog_Action_980500150_409,"(Sighs) Why does every super hero always have a younger brother, mom or dad who's his weak spot..."
Dialog_Action_980500151_101,......
Dialog_Action_980500151_102,"Manta Man, pull yourself together! Only you can defeat the Abyssal Overlord."
Dialog_Action_980500151_103,That said... I have nothing now... My brother...
Dialog_Action_980500151_104,Look at yourself. You are tall and tough. Why would you collapse with a minor blow? Who has no setbacks at all?
Dialog_Action_980500151_105,"The world we live in was destroyed once. And people still climbed out of the ruins and rebuilt civilization. By comparison, what does your setback mean?"
Dialog_Action_980500151_106,Uh? What were you saying? The world was destroyed?
Dialog_Action_980500151_107,"... Anyway, you can still speak to fish, can you not? Try talking to your old friends to see if there is any way to defeat the Abyssal Overlord."
Dialog_Action_980500151_108,OK... I will try. (Manta Man begins to concentrate and tries to talk to the dwellers of the Depths).
Dialog_Action_980500151_109,"Uh... they mock me as a homeless dog. What makes it worse, Bo... The Abyssal Overlord has sent troops after us."
Dialog_Action_980500151_110,"Hey, cheer up, let's get out of here first!"
Dialog_Action_980500151_201,I know the soldiers over there. Maybe I can persuade them to make way.
Dialog_Action_980500151_202,"Hey, Tom! How you doing lately? It looks like you have been promoted. Let me think... Lieutenant Tom, right?"
Dialog_Action_980500151_203,Captain.
Dialog_Action_980500151_204,"Wow, that's amazing. How's your family? How's Jenny?"
Dialog_Action_980500151_205,"Thanks to your negligence of the border, Jenny was taken away by the landers and made into a grilled lobster."
Dialog_Action_980500151_206,Sss... (mumbles) That's awkward...
Dialog_Action_980500151_301,Let me. I can persuade them to make way for us.
Dialog_Action_980500151_302,"Hey, I know you, you are ""Crabby Crab!"" You should know me. I am Manta Man!"
Dialog_Action_980500151_303,"Ah, yes, you are that Manta Man."
Dialog_Action_980500151_304,It seems that my name still works here...
Dialog_Action_980500151_305,"""Graceful strokes of a manta. Tender hair of a maiden! """
Dialog_Action_980500151_306,"Uh-Uhm... Wait a minute, it sounds kinda weird..."
Dialog_Action_980500151_307,"""All but the ability to speak to fish, he's merely a muggle! """
Dialog_Action_980500151_308,What?
Dialog_Action_980500151_309,"Dude, your name has been lousy lately..."
Dialog_Action_980500152_101,"Say Manta Man, truth be told, the public is against you. I don't know if the Abyssal Overlord is behind this or that you were never really good at running your own country."
Dialog_Action_980500152_102,"If you don't do anything now, the Abyssal Overlord and Dr. Brainwash will soon have full control of the Depths!"
Dialog_Action_980500152_103,"Perhaps there is only one way: If I can defeat all the elite guards of the Abyssal Overlord, I will be qualified to challenge him personally."
Dialog_Action_980500152_104,"Although my brother and I often don't get along, he has never done such a thing. All this must be thanks to that Dr. Brainwash."
Dialog_Action_980500152_105,"Even if I have to be my brother's enemy now, I will eventually rescue him from Dr. Brainwash's claws."
Dialog_Action_980500152_106,"That's right, Manta Man. The most important thing about being a hero is not how strong you are, but how you can overcome your emotions."
Dialog_Action_980500152_107,Now let us retake your kingdom and make you the master of the Depths again!
Dialog_Action_980500152_108,"No, I thought about it carefully. My brother really knows how to run a country better than me."
Dialog_Action_980500152_109,"When we beat Dr. Brainwash, I will still let Boris rule the Depths, because this is the right choice."
Dialog_Action_980500152_110,That sounds like a real hero.
Dialog_Action_980500152_201,Manta Man! You have the guts to come here!?!?
Dialog_Action_980500152_202,"Yes, maybe I was depressed for a while, but now I am back!"
Dialog_Action_980500152_203,"Wow, if it were not because I'm a shrimp, I must applaud you now!"
Dialog_Action_980500152_204,I'm really sorry. I have to defeat you in order to challenge the Abyssal Overlord.
Dialog_Action_980500152_301,Look who's coming! Isn't that the homeless Manta Man?
Dialog_Action_980500152_302,"Whatever you say, I must defeat you now to challenge the Abyssal Overlord."
Dialog_Action_980500152_303,"Hah! You are joking! Even if you can challenge the Abyssal Overlord, you are certainly not his opponent!"
Dialog_Action_980500152_304,"Maybe I will fail, but I can no longer choose to escape!"
Dialog_Action_980500152_401,Hah! Manta Man! Hah!
Dialog_Action_980500152_402,I get it. I get it. My name has been lousy lately.
Dialog_Action_980500152_403,"We are ""really"" glad to have you back. ""Really"" hope you can recapture the Depths Kingdom!"
Dialog_Action_980500152_404,"As a shrimp, your level of irony is simply extraordinary. But I still have to defeat you, because only then can I challenge the Abyssal Overlord."
Dialog_Action_980500153_101,"Finally, we face the Abyssal Overlord and Dr. Brainwash once again. Are you ready? Manta Man?"
Dialog_Action_980500153_102,"No, I'm not. I will never have the heart to hurt my brother..."
Dialog_Action_980500153_103,"But if there is anything I've learned from you, it's when the going gets tough, even if you are unprepared, you must come forward, because that is what a hero should do."
Dialog_Action_980500153_104,"Glad you can think that way, Manta Man!"
Dialog_Action_980500153_105,Now let's go make the Abyssal Overlord piss in the pants!
Dialog_Action_980500153_106,"Oh? My dear brother is finally here? Are you here to beg my forgiveness? If that's the case, then you'll be disappointed, I have lived in your shadow for too long!"
Dialog_Action_980500153_107,"Quite the contrary, Boris, I am here to keep you awake!"
Dialog_Action_980500153_108,Hah! Hah! Hahaha! Bring it on. I am waiting for you in the abyss.
Dialog_Action_980500153_201,"Manta Man, glad to see you pulled yourself together, but don't worry, we are here to help you."
Dialog_Action_980500153_202,"I've found the secret of Dr. Brainwash: He wants to use creatures in the Depths to create more biochemical monsters. If we destroy his manufacturing line first, we can slash Dr. Brainwash's power."
Dialog_Action_980500153_203,"And I have cut off Dr. Brainwash's supply on the ground, now let's put an end to his sin!"
Dialog_Action_980500153_204,"Thank you, old friends, but I'll take care of the rest from here."
Dialog_Action_980500153_205,"Dr. Brainwash may have bewitched Boris, but I am the source of his anger. To defeat the Abyssal Overlord, I have to rely on myself."
Dialog_Action_980500153_206,"Um... Good luck then, my friend! Justice will protect you in the most critical times!"
Dialog_Action_980500153_207,Don't force yourself too much. Be prepared for everything.
Dialog_Action_980500153_301,"You finally came to me, my brother."
Dialog_Action_980500153_302,Boris.
Dialog_Action_980500153_303,I said don't call me by that name! I am the Abyssal Overlord! The sea belongs to me!
Dialog_Action_980500153_304,"That's right, that's it, let hate flow in your blood! Kill them!"
Dialog_Action_980500153_305,"I won't fight you, Boris, sober up!"
Dialog_Action_980500153_306,Hah! You don't get to fight him. You've gotta pass my Horror Creatures first!
Dialog_Action_980500153_401,"Good-for-nothing. Abyssal Overlord, it seems that you have to do it yourself."
Dialog_Action_980500153_402,"Boris, can you listen to me?"
Dialog_Action_980500153_403,"Oh? Are you going to lecture me that you are the real master of the Depths? In this case, you are so dead wrong..."
Dialog_Action_980500153_404,"No, I'm here to tell you that you are truly equal to rule the Depths Kingdom."
Dialog_Action_980500153_405,What?
Dialog_Action_980500153_406,"You heard it right. I may be a super hero, but I don't have the ability to govern a country."
Dialog_Action_980500153_407,"And you are the leader who really fits for this country, so at this point, I will support you unconditionally."
Dialog_Action_980500153_408,I... I...
Dialog_Action_980500153_409,But this does not mean that you have to live as a puppet for Dr. Brainwash. This is between us brothers. You don't need to be subject to that villain!
Dialog_Action_980500153_410,That's... That's...
Dialog_Action_980500153_411,"Don't listen to him, Abyssal Overlord, kill him!"
Dialog_Action_980500153_412,"Shut up! He is my brother! Get out of the sea, you filthy bald!"
Dialog_Action_980500153_413,"Hey, that you ""heroes"" still have to win by your mouth than fist really makes me sick. Next time I will not rely on these rubbish anymore, and your good days are near the end."
Dialog_Action_980500153_414,Let's wait and see!
Dialog_Action_980500153_415,A hologram image... That doctor is really a coward.
Dialog_Action_980500153_416,"Let him go. We have time to get it even with him. However, brother, I still want to ask you one thing:"
Dialog_Action_980500153_417,Is my crown really ugly?
Dialog_Action_980500153_418,"No, this is the best crown I have ever seen, brother."
Dialog_Action_990500134_101,"Silver Shroud, why are we here?"
Dialog_Action_990500134_102,Manta Man is at a low point in his life. I think he needs your help this time.
Dialog_Action_990500134_103,"Manta Man only needs a little time to adjust. As a friend, the best help you can offer is to give him time and space."
Dialog_Action_990500134_104,"Meanwhile, we can find Dr. Brainwash's minions under the ground and cut off his contact with the surface, so that Dr. Brainwash will gain no help."
Dialog_Action_990500134_105,Great idea. Manta Man is really lucky to have a friend like you.
Dialog_Action_990500134_106,Then let's set off quickly! Without further ado! The anger of justice is waiting for these gangsters!
Dialog_Action_990500134_107,"Ah, that lame line. Typical of Silver Shroud!"
Dialog_Action_990500134_201,Be careful. Something's going on there.
Dialog_Action_990500134_202,"Harvey, have you heard about that? This time, Boss has a powerful backer!"
Dialog_Action_990500134_203,"Yeah, Dante. I heard that the boss's current backer is a real super villain. Seems to be still a... Dr. Who..."
Dialog_Action_990500134_204,What? How could a doctor be a super villain? Can anyone be a super villain nowadays?
Dialog_Action_990500134_205,"Yeah, I also feel quite puzzled. It seems that he specializes in brain science..."
Dialog_Action_990500134_206,"Ahem. In fact, he is not with medical science. He's Dr. Brainwash."
Dialog_Action_990500134_207,Aah! That makes sense. Doctors become crazy scientists so much often.
Dialog_Action_990500134_208,"That has made everything clear! Wait, who are you, by the way?"
Dialog_Action_990500134_209,"Death has come for you, and I am, its Shroud!"
Dialog_Action_990500134_301,It seems that the leader of these villains is Dr. Brainwash's connector on the ground.
Dialog_Action_990500134_302,Find him and cut off Dr. Brainwash's supplies from his rear.
Dialog_Action_990500134_303,Sounds like a perfect plan.
Dialog_Action_990500134_304,"However, after our previous battle with Dr. Brainwash, his new recruits should have improved. Be prepared, we may have another bitter battle!"
Dialog_Action_990500135_101,"Silver Shroud, can I ask you a question?"
Dialog_Action_990500135_102,Mhm... Justice can't stop here. But you go ahead. I will try to answer.
Dialog_Action_990500135_103,How do you and Manta Man know each other? It seems that he does not often visit these grounds.
Dialog_Action_990500135_104,"One day, me and Mistress of Mystery infiltrated a cruise ship and wanted to hunt down a gang leader who committed too many crimes. In a desperate situation, the guy actually detonated the cruise ship's boiler room!"
Dialog_Action_990500135_105,Sounds scary.
Dialog_Action_990500135_106,"One day, me and Mistress of Mystery infiltrated a cruise ship while hunting down a gang leader that committed too many crimes. He was so desperate that he blew up the cruise ship's boiler room!"
Dialog_Action_990500135_107,He is a respectable friend and his mind is really pure and simple. I hope Manta Man can get out of this darkness as soon as possible... the Unstoppable Alliance needs him.
Dialog_Action_990500135_108,What a great story. Now let's hit the road. Dr. Brainwash's connector is nearby.
Dialog_Action_990500135_201,Welcome to my arena!
Dialog_Action_990500135_202,"Wow, this guy's voice is so magnetic!"
Dialog_Action_990500135_203,"The apocalypse has come, and Dr. Brainwash's grand plan has begun! If you ordinary people want to survive, join the army of Dr. Brainwash as soon as possible. It is the only way out!"
Dialog_Action_990500135_204,What if we say no?
Dialog_Action_990500135_205,"If you do that, you will be burnt by the retribution fire of the Apocalypse! And I am the Knight of Apocalypse!"
Dialog_Action_990500135_206,"Shroud, I think you may have a wonderful chat with this guy!"
Dialog_Action_990500135_207,"Makes no sense to me! What has the incarnation of justice got to say to the sinful! Death is calling you, villain, and..."
Dialog_Action_990500135_208,I... Am... Gonna... Destroy... You! !!
Dialog_Action_990500135_301,"As a result, Dr. Brainwash's supply on the ground is cut off by us."
Dialog_Action_990500135_302,"Uh, Shroud, do you have nothing to say?"
Dialog_Action_990500135_303,I... do not understand what you mean?
Dialog_Action_990500135_304,"Uh, you know... your catchphrase..."
Dialog_Action_990500135_305,"Damn, you're right! It doesn't feel right at all to have the catchphrase interrupted! But seriously, that guy's voice is really nice... ""I am gonna destroy you"" Geez!"
Dialog_Action_980500142_101,"Heroes, we have a very important mission this time."
Dialog_Action_980500142_102,"Long story short, some monsters we encountered in the Depths should be doing of Dr. Brainwash. And our mission this time is to find the source of those monsters."
Dialog_Action_980500142_103,"To be honest, we have also seen a lot of strange creatures. The monsters created by Dr. Brainwash... they always make me wanna laugh..."
Dialog_Action_980500142_104,"That's right, compared with the two-story-high lizard and the grumpy Green Skin, these monsters look just amiable."
Dialog_Action_980500142_105,You... sure have quite stories. I have never seen the monsters you mentioned. It's about the time. Let's get going!
Dialog_Action_980500142_201,"Hey, something is wrong."
Dialog_Action_980500142_202,This guy looks... Not so stable...
Dialog_Action_980500142_203,"I think it's pretty cute. If we can tame it, I'll give it a name, what about Jeff?"
Dialog_Action_980500142_204,Je--ff! !! !
Dialog_Action_980500142_205,It seems that the marine creatures in this experiment have not been able to adapt to the land environment yet.
Dialog_Action_980500142_206,"But this also means that our time is running out. And if left unattended, these monsters will be swarming on the ground."
Dialog_Action_980500142_207,Jeffs everywhere...
Dialog_Action_980500142_208,"Don't forget to look around, we may be able to find some clues left behind."
Dialog_Action_980500142_209,Look. A holotape here. Maybe it's an experimental record?
Dialog_Action_980500142_210,Let's listen.
Dialog_Action_980500142_211,(The voice of Dr. Brainwash) Aha! Do you think I will record important information in this kind of holotape like everywhere? I'm a doctor!
Dialog_Action_980500142_212,"Damn, this cunning guy is still a hard nut to crack. No other way around. Have to search other suspicious places to see if we can find some clues."
Dialog_Action_980500143_101,"Mistress of Mystery, you seem to be very worried, are there any problems?"
Dialog_Action_980500143_102,"Huh? Ah, sorry, I was distracted..."
Dialog_Action_980500143_103,What could distract the Mistress of Mystery?
Dialog_Action_980500143_104,"I was thinking something that has happened recently is not right. It 's not the first time I have dealt with a Dr. Brainwash, working with Silver Shroud, but the recent actions of this guy... Just don't feel right..."
Dialog_Action_980500143_105,Maybe it's Dr. Brainwash's technique has recently upgraded?
Dialog_Action_980500143_106,"No, it's not that simple... All in all, here is another terminal of Dr. Brainwash on the ground. Maybe we can find some clues here?"
Dialog_Action_980500143_201,I've found a holotape...
Dialog_Action_980500143_202,"Based on previous experience, Dr. Brainwash will not leave us any clues."
Dialog_Action_980500143_203,"Anyway, it doesn't hurt to listen."
Dialog_Action_980500143_204,(The voice of Dr. Brainwash) You are really persevering... I will give you some tips in light of your efforts:
Dialog_Action_980500143_205,"Your efforts are all in vain, because your investigation has been wrong from the beginning."
Dialog_Action_980500143_206,What is he trying to say?
Dialog_Action_980500143_207,This is where the strangest thing is. Dr. Brainwash has never left us with such ambiguous riddles. This is not his style.
Dialog_Action_980500143_301,I think he seems to have something in his words. There must be some important information hidden in this puzzle.
Dialog_Action_980500143_302,"Look, a holotape!"
Dialog_Action_980500143_303,Shall we come and listen?
Dialog_Action_980500143_304,"(The voice of Dr. Brainwash) Are you still here? Hey, really a bunch of guys who don't know what to do."
Dialog_Action_980500143_305,"Listen well: the more you want to control this drama, the more likely it will end in unexpected directions, so you should give up!"
Dialog_Action_980500143_306,"Hmm... A strange riddle... But even stranger, his tone doesn't sound hostile."
Dialog_Action_980500143_307,Doesn't sound hostile? His bitterness makes me wanna open a few holes in his head!
Dialog_Action_980500143_308,But he obviously means something...
Dialog_Action_980500143_401,"So, what is the meaning of these strange holotapes?"
Dialog_Action_980500143_402,I... need to investigate again...
Dialog_Action_980500143_403,"If we investigate further, the Manta Man's Depths may be completely taken over by Dr. Brainwash and the Abyssal Overlord!"
Dialog_Action_980500143_404,"That's right. The longer we stay here, the closer the Abyssal Overlord is to controlling the Depths."
Dialog_Action_980500143_405,"Okay, maybe you are right. Let us rush back and help Manta Man now!"
Dialog_Action_980500163_101,"Lady Irma, although I appreciate your help, I don't think Peter, that old fox, has left any clues here."
Dialog_Action_980500163_102,"Yeah, what's the point of reconnecting to ""Hubris Adventure"" again? Peter has run away with his data. We will only be wasting time here..."
Dialog_Action_980500163_103,"On the contrary, ""Hubris Adventure"" may be our only hope."
Dialog_Action_980500163_104,"That Peter you mentioned is very smart, he did not leave many clues on the Wasteland. But he forgot one thing: when he tested ""Hubris Adventure"" as tourist, code TS001, some of his key memories will also be automatically recorded by the system."
Dialog_Action_980500163_105,"Are you saying that if we continue to run the ""Hubris Adventure"" virtual reality experience he has had, we can find clues in his memory?"
Dialog_Action_980500163_106,"That's right, Peter may have used virtual reality technology to get many experimental data that Hubris ignored, but he would never think that his only flaw was also left in virtual reality."
Dialog_Action_980500163_107,"Across the entire Commonwealth, nobody has a better understanding of virtual reality technology than I do. I can certainly find a solution to the memory he left in the ""Hubris Adventure."""
Dialog_Action_980500163_108,"My God, this may really work..."
Dialog_Action_980500163_109,Let's hurry to find the console!
Dialog_Action_980500163_201,"Let me see... Very well, almost what I expected."
Dialog_Action_980500163_202,Are you ready? We are going to connect.
Dialog_Action_980500163_203,Of course.
Dialog_Action_980500163_204,"We are already familiar with this process, Lady Irma, hurry up and connect."
Dialog_Action_980500163_205,"Very good, I will monitor your data here throughout, once I find TS001-- that is, Peter 's clues, I will notify you."
Dialog_Action_980500163_206,"Good luck, Kent is all yours... We all count on you."
Dialog_Action_980500163_207,"Rest assured, Lady Irma, we got this!"
Dialog_Action_980500164_101,(Radio) Do you read me? Does that thing work well... Please reply if you read me!
Dialog_Action_980500164_102,Loud and clear.
Dialog_Action_980500164_103,"(Radio) Roger. The coordinates I provide you this time are the positions analyzed from Peter's memory. Maybe we can find the clues he left here, but I don't know where to find these things."
Dialog_Action_980500164_104,So... Are we just looking everywhere for it like this?
Dialog_Action_980500164_105,"I think so... Actually, I don't even know what we are looking for, but since Peter has a deep memory of this place, we will always find some clues, won't we?"
Dialog_Action_980500164_106,This... Sounds very far-fetched.
Dialog_Action_980500164_107,Do you have a better idea?
Dialog_Action_980500164_108,(Shrugs) Makes sense.
Dialog_Action_980500164_201,(Radio) The coordinates extracted from the memory are near you. Look around for clues.
Dialog_Action_980500164_202,Easier said... Where are we supposed to find...
Dialog_Action_980500164_203,"Look, there is a holotape."
Dialog_Action_980500164_204,What? !
Dialog_Action_980500164_205,"(Radio) Hurry up and listen, maybe this is the only valuable clue."
Dialog_Action_980500164_206,Sss... Duh... I don't know how many years we've been traveling on the Wasteland...
Dialog_Action_980500164_207,"With the Ghoul's physique, I can easily live in a harsh environment, and time has lost its meaning to me... But even so, I am just catching my breaths."
Dialog_Action_980500164_208,"I have been to many places on the Wasteland for so many years since the disaster, and I have done a lot of weird jobs to survive, but I always feel that I have lost something..."
Dialog_Action_980500164_209,"To survive this kind of disaster, one that can literally destroy the world, God needs me to complete a mission. If I can't find my mission in the Wasteland, what 's the difference between me and a Feral Ghoul?"
Dialog_Action_980500164_210,"Interestingly, is this a diary left by Peter? It seems that he has not always been so mad."
Dialog_Action_980500164_211,"No, I think Peter is a very self-disciplined and calm person, so he is the most difficult enemy, he knows what he needs to do..."
Dialog_Action_980500164_212,"(Radio) Maybe something happened that changed Peter's view of many things and made him what he is now. If we can find more holotapes, we may be able to understand his motives."
Dialog_Action_980500164_213,Understanding our enemies... is the key to victory.
Dialog_Action_980500165_101,"(Radio) As before, I have sent you the coordinates extracted from Peter's memory. See if we can find any clues this time. Over."
Dialog_Action_980500165_102,Over? That's it?
Dialog_Action_980500165_103,"Your mission statement is really simple, Lady Irma."
Dialog_Action_980500165_104,"(Radio) Yeah, my time is very precious. The Memory Den still has to operate as usual, right?"
Dialog_Action_980500165_105,"That said, I'm sure Peter must have stayed here. The smell of violet here is too familiar to me. Peter must have experimented with hallucinogenic perfumes here."
Dialog_Action_980500165_106,"That's right, so we better be careful. I still remember the previous few times when we were trapped in a room full of these gases and almost lost our lives."
Dialog_Action_980500165_201,"Did you find any clues? We'd better hurry up, we can't stay in this place for too long."
Dialog_Action_980500165_202,"Here, a holotape, maybe Peter's diary."
Dialog_Action_980500165_203,(Radio) Then let's hurry and listen.
Dialog_Action_980500165_204,"Hiss... Duh... I have to say that I really didn't expect this to happen, but the last time I walked among the ruins of the Commonwealth, I suddenly received a signal from a radio station that was broadcasting a radio drama of Silver Shroud!"
Dialog_Action_980500165_205,"At that time, I was stunned. I didn't think that after the entire disaster of the world and after so many years, some people would still remember the characters of the Hubris Comics, and even made a radio station to broadcast radio dramas..."
Dialog_Action_980500165_206,"After a period of investigation, I learned that the ""Silver Shroud"" radio station was established by a ghoul named Kent Connery. He... is a loyal fan of Hubris, and he even hopes to bring Silver Shroud to the Wasteland for real."
Dialog_Action_980500165_207,"Although I can understand him, it is still a humiliation to Hubris... No, it is a humiliation to all survivors of the disaster."
Dialog_Action_980500165_208,"After the disaster, I thought for a long time. Although I hate to admit it, the fictional comic stories we made are indeed the epitome of humans escaping from the reality driven by consumerism."
Dialog_Action_980500165_209,"It is precisely in that escape that humans will turn a blind eye to crises, disasters, and conflicts, and ultimately cause the destruction of the world."
Dialog_Action_980500165_210,"Although these relics of the old world are the only proof of my existence, they can no longer be the spiritual food of the empty Wastelanders... Only by letting them disappear completely can the survivors truly face their own problems and faults."
Dialog_Action_980500165_211,"So... in fact, Peter's real purpose is to make Hubris Comics completely disappear?"
Dialog_Action_980500165_212,What a twisted guy...
Dialog_Action_980500165_213,"(Radio) But it doesn't make sense. If he wants to make the comics completely disappear from the Wasteland, why would he bring those characters from the comics to the Wasteland?"
Dialog_Action_980500165_214,"Maybe after we find more clues, we can understand what this guy is thinking... Although never really have met him, I do feel this guy is really a weirdo."
Dialog_Action_980500166_101,"(Radio) Friends, we are running out of time and resources. The memories that can be extracted from the ""Hubris Adventure"" are limited. If we can't find any useful clues, then soon we will have no memories to extract."
Dialog_Action_980500166_102,"Is there any way around? Originally we were looking for clues from these memories as if searching a needle in a haystack, and all we could find were these holotapes."
Dialog_Action_980500166_103,"Cool it off. Be patient. Peter spent so much time on his plan, can't we even wait for a short period?"
Dialog_Action_980500166_104,(Radio) I just... worry that Kent won't be able to hold it for so long. I don't know what that evil guy will do to Kent...
Dialog_Action_980500166_105,"I don't think you need to worry. Although Peter kidnapped Kent, he's not an irritable Raider... Kent's encounter was very similar to him, maybe they had many common topics."
Dialog_Action_980500166_106,"(Radio) That... is a very reasonable guess, but I'd rather not imagine these possibilities... Let's concentrate on finding the clues left by Peter!"
Dialog_Action_980500166_201,"Look, there's a holotape hidden here... Will it be different this time?"
Dialog_Action_980500166_202,"We will find out, and now I 'm already used to the strange stories in these holotapes."
Dialog_Action_980500166_203,"(Peter's voice in the tape) Kent, after such a terrible disaster, I thought you were the only one who could understand me. Didn't expect that I couldn't talk you out of this..."
Dialog_Action_980500166_204,"(Kent's voice in the tape) You 're crazy! Peter! These comics... these super heroes are simply a few pastimes of Wastelanders... and this is also your own hard work, don't you feel distressed?"
Dialog_Action_980500166_205,"These pastimes are just an escape, which is irresponsible! Am I not making myself clear enough? Kent, Kent! Look at this world now! Human irresponsibility has long destroyed this world! No hero is needed in this world!"
Dialog_Action_980500166_206,"No, you are wrong. Even if the world is already a wasteland, super heroes can become their role models..."
Dialog_Action_980500166_207,"Do you mean Shannon Rivers and the Mystery Order she established? See what they end up with! Regretfully, this unrealistic fantasy of Shannon and her followers..."
Dialog_Action_980500166_208,And your perseverance in Silver Shroud is the source of tragedy.
Dialog_Action_980500166_209,(The two seems silent for a long time...)
Dialog_Action_980500166_210,"So, what do you want to do? Do you want to find all the comics and tapes and destroy them?"
Dialog_Action_980500166_211,"No, quite the opposite. If my plan goes well, the Wastelanders will naturally do that for me."
Dialog_Action_980500166_212,"As long as my ""super heroes"" and ""super villains"" create some chaos in the Wasteland, Hubris will no longer be synonymous with heroes and justice."
Dialog_Action_980500166_213,"When Hubris collapses within the Wastelanders, they will make these comics completely disappear."
Dialog_Action_980500166_214,You are crazy! Peter!
Dialog_Action_980500166_215,"This is really a simple and efficient plan. Most people on the Wasteland do not have the ability to discern right from wrong, they only believe what they see."
Dialog_Action_980500166_216,"As long as the ""super heroes"" sent by Peter create enough chaos, then Hubris will be spurned by the Wastelanders... Sure enough it's an idea from someone who has enough knowledge of the media..."
Dialog_Action_980500166_217,"Lady Irma, can you find any clues we can use from this holotape?"
Dialog_Action_980500166_218,"(Radio) I need some time to separate the sound source from the holotape... I am happy to know that Kent is still alive. Although this old ghoul often troubles me, he is still a rare friend."
Dialog_Action_980500166_219,"Rest easy, Lady Irma, he will be fine... probably."
Dialog_Action_980500167_101,"(Radio) Based on my analysis of the sound source in the last holotape, I found this place."
Dialog_Action_980500167_102,So it is likely to be Peter's base? And Kent should be locked here?
Dialog_Action_980500167_103,"(Radio) I hope so, but based on previous experience, Peter is likely to have already run away."
Dialog_Action_980500167_104,"Or maybe he prepared a trap, waiting for us to jump in."
Dialog_Action_980500167_105,"(Radio) Anyway, we have to find out. Are you ready, people?"
Dialog_Action_980500167_106,(Shrugs) He who would catch fish must not mind getting wet. Let's go!
Dialog_Action_980500167_201,"Another synth super hero, which should be the weapon Peter used to create chaos! From its appearance, it is getting closer and closer to the complete version."
Dialog_Action_980500167_202,"(Synth super hero suddenly gives the voice of Peter Sharna) Welcome, my old friends, here we are."
Dialog_Action_980500167_203,"Peter! Damn, he is playing us!"
Dialog_Action_980500167_204,"To be precise, I'm just delaying time. I never wanted to trick you, after all, you are my important experimental partners."
Dialog_Action_980500167_205,Who are your experimental partners?
Dialog_Action_980500167_206,Where did Kent go?
Dialog_Action_980500167_207,"Believe me, I never thought of embarrassing Kent. Now I have got everything I need, and keeping him is just cumbersome."
Dialog_Action_980500167_208,"Let's play a game. If you can win my synth super hero, I will tell you where Kent is."
Dialog_Action_980500167_209,"Damn, he is really playing us!"
Dialog_Action_980500167_210,"Beware, that mechanical monster is about to attack!"
Dialog_Action_980500167_301,"(Peter's voice is heard again from the broken synth) Well done, it seems that my servant still has much to be improved."
Dialog_Action_980500167_302,"I have sent the coordinates of detained Kent to your Pip-Boy, I wish you luck."
Dialog_Action_980500167_303,"Peter, we have listened to your holotapes. We know your motives. You don't have to do this!"
Dialog_Action_980500167_304,"Now that you have listened to my logs, you should understand that only by completely destroying these comics can humans stop repeating their mistakes!"
Dialog_Action_980500167_305,"God, you are really stubborn! You actually think you are going for greatness!"
Dialog_Action_980500167_306,"Soon the Wasteland will usher in real salvation, and I will thank you for everything you have given. Before that, everything you say is in vain."
Dialog_Action_980500168_101,"According to the coordinates Peter sent us, Kent should be right here."
Dialog_Action_980500168_102,Will Peter really hand over Kent so easily? I always feel that he must still have cards up his sleeves.
Dialog_Action_980500168_103,"(Radio) Don't think so much, Peter's purpose is to delay our time. If we can't act as soon as possible, we will fit in right with his wish."
Dialog_Action_980500168_104,Should we not calm down and discuss the countermeasures first? I think our recent reckless behaviors are no different from a group of angry super mutants.
Dialog_Action_980500168_105,"Hah! You finally woke up to that! Since we were involved in this series of ""Hubris"" stuff, we have been played by Peter, and a group of angry super mutants is really the most appropriate analogy to us."
Dialog_Action_980500168_106,"You are telling me. I still remember that our original purpose was just to read comics... I did not expect that the ""Hubris Adventure, "" which was sealed two hundred years ago, could cause such a big trouble today."
Dialog_Action_980500168_107,"(Radio) Gentlemen, friends. It is great to see that you can remain optimistic at such a critical time. But I think we should be doing something right, that old ghoul Kent is still waiting for us to rescue him!"
Dialog_Action_980500168_201,The anger of justice will not go out! Prepare to accept the sanctions of the Unstoppable Alliance!
Dialog_Action_980500168_202,Come again? It seems that Peter really has made a lot of such machine minions.
Dialog_Action_980500168_203,"Truth be told, their lines sound not bad."
Dialog_Action_980500168_204,(Kent's voice from next door) Is someone here? Help! Help!
Dialog_Action_980500168_205,"That voice, are you Kent?"
Dialog_Action_980500168_206,Who else can there be! Do something and save me from the fake heroes created by that lunatic!
Dialog_Action_980500168_207,"Hold on, Kent!"
Dialog_Action_980500168_208,"Evil gangsters! Your plan has already been disrupted by the Unstoppable Alliance, ready to meet your end!"
Dialog_Action_980500168_301,Thank goodness you guys are here in time. But who are you and how did you find it?
Dialog_Action_980500168_302,Kent! You old idiot is fine...
Dialog_Action_980500168_303,"These are friends from the Vault. Long story short, they were also deceived by Peter, and with some clues, they finally traced your position."
Dialog_Action_980500168_304,"Oh, don't mention it. Kent, your ""old friend"" has made us suffer a lot!"
Dialog_Action_980500168_305,"From the beginning, he used your identity to trick us into Hubris to play the damn ""Hubris Adventure"" and mark my words, he' a bastard who has lived for more than 200 years!"
Dialog_Action_980500168_306,(Laughter of Kent) Ha! Haha! I have heard about Peter... We... actually talked a lot. Such a crazy idea is not incomprehensible for an encounter like his...
Dialog_Action_980500168_307,"Don't get fooled by him, Kent, every anti-social lunatic has a set of reasons to excuse himself."
Dialog_Action_980500168_308,"What we care about is that you may be the one among us who knows about Hubris, and Peter the best. In a situation like this, Peter is already a few steps ahead of us. Is there any way we can save the situation?"
Dialog_Action_980500168_309,"Yes, yes... About this... I think, um... since Peter can extract data from ""Hubris Adventure"" to create his army, then... can we also do the opposite? That is, bring the real super heroes to the Wasteland?"
Dialog_Action_980500168_310,Your plan... will it really work?
Dialog_Action_980500168_311,"I mean... The super heroes in the ""Hubris Adventure"" are actually the AIs with the characters closest to those of the heroes themselves. If we can liberate these AIs from virtual reality and put them into the body of the synths..."
Dialog_Action_980500168_312,"Oh my god, he's right. It is not without such an example before. The Memory Den once put an AI named Curie into the body of a synth... We are fully conditional to realize Kent's idea!"
Dialog_Action_980500168_313,"In this way, we will be able to pay him back in his own coin! To defeat those fake heroes, you still have to rely on real super heroes!"
Dialog_Action_980500168_314,"So, how do we start? How to ""liberate"" the AIs in those comic worlds?"
Dialog_Action_980500168_315,"The ""Hubris Adventure"" is not over yet, friends. Maybe there we can find the answer."
Dialog_Action_980500190_101,Wh-what the hell is this place? How come we got into this primitive jungle? Could it be that Lady Irma has thrown us to the prehistoric era?
Dialog_Action_980500190_102,"(Radio) Calm down. Calm down. Although this is my first time to operate ""Hubris Adventure, "" but my settings are absolutely no problem. Let 's see what happens next!"
Dialog_Action_980500190_103,"Very good, heroes, you came in time. We need your help."
Dialog_Action_980500190_104,"We are looking for a very key member of the Unstoppable Alliance, he is brave and fearless, he is powerful and he is famous-"
Dialog_Action_980500190_105,Grognak the Barbarian!
Dialog_Action_980500190_106,"Hey, man, don't interrupt me, but this is the introduction line I've thought for a long time."
Dialog_Action_980500190_107,"Sorry, sorry, thinking such a great hero is about to join us, I can't help myself."
Dialog_Action_980500190_108,"You bet, this guy has that unique charm..."
Dialog_Action_980500190_109,"Okay, guys, don't be so excited. We don't know where he is yet."
Dialog_Action_980500190_110,"Uh, if I may, there seems to be a strong man fighting a bear not far away? Is this common?"
Dialog_Action_980500190_111,"Aha, you can't resist my full blow!"
Dialog_Action_980500190_112,"Grognak casts a ""powerful blow"" on the forest bear. The attack rolls 9 and the hit bonus is 10 + 5 + 2 + 1. The forest bear's AC is 30. Grognak's attack missed!"
Dialog_Action_980500190_113,Damn it!
Dialog_Action_980500190_114,Uh... Can anyone explain to me what's going on here?
Dialog_Action_980500190_115,"Ah, friends! Nice to meet you, are you also participants in this tournament?"
Dialog_Action_980500190_116,"I'm afraid not, old friend Grognak. We are reorganizing the Unstoppable Alliance, and you are one of our most important members."
Dialog_Action_980500190_117,"Ah, sorry. I cannot accept your invitation for the time being. As you can see, I am participating in this tournament called ""Eternal Champion."" The champion's loot is the legendary ""Eternal Axe."" I must get it!"
Dialog_Action_980500190_118,"Uh, what kind of axe matters so much?"
Dialog_Action_980500190_119,"Haha, Manta Man, my brother, compared with ""Eternal Axe"" this broken axe in my hand is like a fruit knife! Ah, yes, let's team up together! That way, the championship is as good as ours!"
Dialog_Action_980500190_120,How can we help you?
Dialog_Action_980500190_121,We can start by kicking this smelly bear! Come on! For the glory of battle!
Dialog_Action_980500190_201,Wonderful battle! Heroes!
Dialog_Action_980500190_202,"It seems that another team of warriors has passed the warm-up trial of ""Eternal Champion"" tournament! Can they go all the way and become the true ""Eternal Champion""? Let us wait and see!"
Dialog_Action_980500190_203,"After a warm-up trial, comes the real challenge. Our warriors need to obtain three ""Hero's Seal"" from extremely dangerous enemies."
Dialog_Action_980500190_204,This does not sound troublesome.
Dialog_Action_980500190_205,"How to get it? Of course, kill some notorious enemies!"
Dialog_Action_980500190_206,"Ha, ahead of you."
Dialog_Action_980500190_207,"Don't worry, Grognak, we will help you get the Hero's Seal in other places. You just have to concentrate on the battle here."
Dialog_Action_980500190_208,"Very good, I'll trust you young hot-blooded men with killing and all. I still have some... unfinished investigations. Excuse me!"
Dialog_Action_980500190_209,"Mistress of Mystery is... really mysterious. Okay, heroes, let's kick some butt! Glory and wealth are waiting for us!"
Dialog_Action_980500191_101,Welcome! Warriors! Welcome to the new battlefield. Are you ready to start this great battle of glory?
Dialog_Action_980500191_102,Tell me about it. We are ready for way too long.
Dialog_Action_980500191_103,Uh... is there something missing... where did Grognak go?
Dialog_Action_980500191_104,"This time, they will face... Do you feel the rushing heat wave and the crackling lightning in the air?"
Dialog_Action_980500191_105,This does not sound good...
Dialog_Action_980500191_106,"The mythical beast from the ancient times, mysterious, powerful, and grumpy, I present you -- the Kukulcan King! !"
Dialog_Action_980500191_107,This looks very bad!
Dialog_Action_980500191_108,"And our challenger, Grognak the Barbarian, and members of the Unstoppable Alliance... Uh, where is Grognak?"
Dialog_Action_980500191_109,"That's our question, too!"
Dialog_Action_980500191_110,"Ugly monster, take my Backstab! Hah!"
Dialog_Action_980500191_111,"Oops, it seems that some people have not read the Dungeon Monster Manual. the Kukulcan King is immune to all Backstab damage, which is a fatal mistake!"
Dialog_Action_980500191_112,It seems that the the Kukulcan King is angry! Can our challenges overcome this furious beast?
Dialog_Action_980500191_201,"Nice job, warriors!"
Dialog_Action_980500191_202,"If it weren't for your recklessness, the battle could have ended faster..."
Dialog_Action_980500191_203,Hah! Isn't that more challenging?
Dialog_Action_980500191_204,"Wonderful! Wonderful! This ""Hero's Seal"" is yours. To think you could overcome the anger of the Kukulcan King!"
Dialog_Action_980500191_205,Glorious victory! Let's celebrate!
Dialog_Action_980500191_206,But how? Would you like a drink?
Dialog_Action_980500191_207,"Of course it is to be celebrated with a more intense battle! Let's go, heroes! Glory is awaiting us!"
Dialog_Action_980500191_208,"Hey, why can't I get out of this place? What kind of witchcraft is this?"
Dialog_Action_980500191_209,You must gather your team to move on.
Dialog_Action_980500191_210,Uh... Mmm... heroes! Let's get going! !!
Dialog_Action_980500191_211,"Alright, alright!"
Dialog_Action_980500192_101,"It seems that our challengers have returned to the main arena of ""Eternal Champion, "" do you have enough Hero's Seal?"
Dialog_Action_980500192_102,I have one here.
Dialog_Action_980500192_103,So do I.
Dialog_Action_980500192_104,"I have one, too, so we have three Hero's Seal!"
Dialog_Action_980500192_105,Splendid! It seems that our warriors are ready to face the ultimate challenge!
Dialog_Action_980500192_106,Can't wait.
Dialog_Action_980500192_107,"But what they will face is the defending champion of the tournament, a cruel, ferocious, ugly but extremely powerful swordsman-- The Fatherless Beast!"
Dialog_Action_980500192_108,Who dare to call me ugly? Don't you idiot want to live? !
Dialog_Action_980500192_109,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, it is a handsome and charming beast-- the Fatherless Beast!"
Dialog_Action_980500192_110,"That's more like it. Now, which fool does not know what to do but dare to challenge the invincible Fatherless Beast?"
Dialog_Action_980500192_111,"Fatherless Beast, why call yourself like that?"
Dialog_Action_980500192_112,"Of course because I killed my father! How about it, am I cruel and cold-blooded?"
Dialog_Action_980500192_113,"(Gasps) Despicable monster! Such a shameless and ruthless villain must be sanctioned! Heroes, are you also angry because of this guy's meanness?"
Dialog_Action_980500192_114,"I doubt it. In our world, humans once destroyed the planet they lived in, and even regarded their compatriots as experimental animals. The Fatherless Beast is next to despicable in comparison"
Dialog_Action_980500192_115,"What? Are you crazy! Even we wouldn't destroy our own world, however so exaggerated it is... You are... Chaos and evils! Chaos and evils!"
Dialog_Action_980500192_116,"That's agree to disagree, but you should now understand that your intimidation does not work at all."
Dialog_Action_980500192_117,Hell! Woarrrrrgh!
Dialog_Action_980500192_201,"I expected more from the ""Fatherless Beast."""
Dialog_Action_980500192_202,Well done! Heroes! I knew this ugly monster was not our opponent!
Dialog_Action_980500192_203,"In- Cre- Di- Ble! It seems that our championship has a new ""Eternal Champion!"" Grognak the Barbarian! He will get the final loot: Eternal Axe!"
Dialog_Action_980500192_204,So much to be expected!
Dialog_Action_980500192_205,"Now come closer, I will personally confer upon you this honor that only the most powerful warrior deserves!"
Dialog_Action_980500192_206,"Ah, what a glorious day!"
Dialog_Action_980500192_207,Yeah... yeah... closer...
Dialog_Action_980500192_208,Aah! You are! !
Dialog_Action_980500192_209,Dr. Brainwash!
Dialog_Action_980500192_210,"Hahahahaha! I didn't expect you guys to be so gullible! Especially this barbarian with muscles filling his brain... Hahahaha, he really thought there was an ""Eternal Axe!"""
Dialog_Action_980500192_211,"Is this whole tournament your trick, Dr. Brainwash? What about Grognak? Where did you get him?"
Dialog_Action_980500192_212,"Think about it with your little brains? I carefully arranged such a scam just to invite him to have an afternoon tea? Of course, he was brainwashed! !"
Dialog_Action_980500192_213,Hell! We will not let you have your way!
Dialog_Action_980500192_214,"(Dr. Brainwash suddenly puts away the smile on his face, which makes everyone feel chilly) You have chased me for so long, and it is time to give you a chance."
Dialog_Action_980500192_215,"Come and fight me in my arena. If you win, I might consider returning the brawny guy full of muscles in his brain."
Dialog_Action_980500192_216,Oh? You coward finally dares to confront us personally? Interesting!
Dialog_Action_980500192_217,"Hold me in expectation. Let's see who is the real ""Eternal Champion."""
Dialog_Action_980500193_101,"(Applauses slowly) You are finally here, and I have already grown a little impatient."
Dialog_Action_980500193_102,"Dr. Brainwash, you are such a cliché villain! Can you applaud a little slower?"
Dialog_Action_980500193_103,"What do your little brains know? You can't think about the problem from the big picture, that's why I've been playing around with you."
Dialog_Action_980500193_104,"Oh? Now that you can control the overall situation behind the scenes, why do you want to come and fight with us this time? Are you not afraid of getting your hands dirty?"
Dialog_Action_980500193_105,"I certainly have my own reasons, but today you are here to fight, not to chat. Then show me what you've got!"
Dialog_Action_980500193_201,"Aha, you are done for! Dr. Brainwash!"
Dialog_Action_980500193_202,Oh? Not so fast.
Dialog_Action_980500193_203,This is still his hologram! We had a fight with a hologram!
Dialog_Action_980500193_204,"Damn it, is this bastard playing us like a fool?"
Dialog_Action_980500193_205,"That's right, but this is not the point. The important thing is that you have proved your strength, then as agreed, I will now return Grognak to you."
Dialog_Action_980500193_206,Catch you later. Hmm-hahahaha!
Dialog_Action_980500193_207,"Damn it, what a witchcraft this is! ?... Heroes, why are you here? Why is my head feeling dizzy..."
Dialog_Action_980500193_208,"Take it easy, Grognak, we are all tricked by Dr. Brainwash, but we should be safe for now."
Dialog_Action_980500193_209,Damn... My glorious battle...
Dialog_Action_980500193_210,What have we missed?
Dialog_Action_980500193_211,"It seems that I've missed a lot of wonderful things. Heroes, Grognak, how are you doing?"
Dialog_Action_980500193_212,"In addition to being very unhappy, we are okay."
Dialog_Action_980500193_213,Hah! Grognak will not be troubled by these little things. The next epic battle is still waiting for us!
Dialog_Action_980500193_214,"Guys, I am very happy to see that you are still optimistic as always. But I'm afraid I want to bring you some unpleasant news."
Dialog_Action_980500193_215,How can news from an attractive lady like you be unpleasant? Only that base Dr. Brainwasher will say something unpleasant.
Dialog_Action_980500193_216,But the news I want to bring is just about Dr. Brainwash... I am afraid our old opponent is not as simple as we thought...
Dialog_Action_980500193_217,What were you saying? Is there anything we don't know at all about an evil guy like him?
Dialog_Action_980500193_218,"Maybe it 's a woman's intuition, from the moment we confronted Dr. Brainwash, I felt something was wrong. So I secretly started investigating Dr. Brainwash and found that he has been trying to leave us some mysterious messages."
Dialog_Action_980500193_219,"With the help of these heroes, I finally gathered these messages, and then deciphered the hidden messages. Sit tight, you may find these messages unacceptable for a while."
Dialog_Action_980500193_220,"Don't beat about the bush, Mistress of Mystery, I am very open-minded."
Dialog_Action_980500193_221,"Me, you, all the Unstoppable Alliance, and Dr. Brainwash are artificial intelligence in a virtual reality device."
Dialog_Action_980500193_222,Wh-What are you talking about? I'm not accepting this!
Dialog_Action_980500193_223,"... All of us are carefully designed, whether in terms of memory, ability or character, exactly the same way as our real selves. The meaning of our existence is to provide these heroes with a realistic ""caricature"" experience."
Dialog_Action_980500193_224,(Whispers) Is that not good?
Dialog_Action_980500193_225,"(Whispers) Quiet, let us wait and see."
Dialog_Action_980500193_226,"In the normal virtual experience program, we will knock down Dr. Brainwash according to the plot of the comic. Then the program will be reset for a new adventure."
Dialog_Action_980500193_227,But Dr. Brainwash's AI was artificially intervened. A very sinister guy controlled Dr. Brainwash's behavior and used his identity to gather information about every battle of ours in the virtual world.
Dialog_Action_980500193_228,"And Dr. Brainwash was also the first to realize his existence because of this artificial tampering. In most cases, he can not control his behavior, so he can only rely on these hidden messages to provide us with information."
Dialog_Action_980500193_229,You mean... Dr. Brainwash is actually not our real enemy?
Dialog_Action_980500193_230,"In theory, we still have to fight Dr. Brainwash based on the designed plot. But our real enemy is actually the guy who controls Dr. Brainwash behind the scenes. Am I not right, heroes?"
Dialog_Action_980500193_231,Pretty close. I am worried about how to tell you all this in order to make it easier for you to accept...
Dialog_Action_980500193_232,"Although I don't understand what you are talking about, what are we going to do now?"
Dialog_Action_980500193_233,"For now, we can only complete the established plot and beat Dr. Brainwash. And for this, we need to find the last member of the Unstoppable Alliance-- The Inspector!"
Dialog_Action_980500193_234,Ah... that's a hard-to-find guy...
Dialog_Action_980500169_101,"Welcome, warriors! Welcome to the arena of ""Eternal Champion"" tournament. It seems that our warriors have assembled, led by --"
Dialog_Action_980500169_102,"It's the mist shrouding the death, the Silver Shroud!"
Dialog_Action_980500169_103,Hah! What an imposing manner. So let's see if they can stand out in today's tournament.
Dialog_Action_980500169_104,"Before that I have a question, why is this arena... completely different from Grognak's then?"
Dialog_Action_980500169_105,"This is the interesting part of ""Eternal Champion."" our tournament will go through any time and any place. That's why it's called ""Eternal, "" right?"
Dialog_Action_980500169_106,This explanation is barely convincing...
Dialog_Action_980500169_107,"... You only need to know that you must defeat a very powerful and dangerous enemy in order to get the Hero's Seal. But whether you can find it through the path full of thorns and traps, it depends on your ability!"
Dialog_Action_980500169_108,"Come on, like every single path we've trod on is not full of thorns and traps."
Dialog_Action_980500169_201,You feel something's off. There must be something wrong with this room. You need to roll the Perception Dice once.
Dialog_Action_980500169_202,"What is ""Perception Dice""..."
Dialog_Action_980500169_203,That does not sound like a good thing.
Dialog_Action_980500169_204,"You rolled 1, fatal mistake! You have triggered an alarm and the enemies have gathered around!"
Dialog_Action_980500169_205,"Well, it turns out that ""traps"" refer to this... This rule is too unfriendly to us!"
Dialog_Action_980500169_301,Congratulations! You happen to find a box of hidden treasures!
Dialog_Action_980500169_302,What? Do I have that luck?
Dialog_Action_980500169_303,You need to roll the Luck Dice once to determine what treasure you will get.
Dialog_Action_980500169_304,"Does that also require a dice roll? Well, at least nothing bad will happen, right? Right?"
Dialog_Action_980500169_305,"Whoops... You rolled 1, fatal mistake! You open the hidden treasure box and find that it contains a pile of rancid sludge, which disgusts you so much that you almost spit out the dinner."
Dialog_Action_980500169_306,That's too nonsensical!
Dialog_Action_980500169_401,"Be careful, you can feel powerful enemies lurking in this room. But you can choose to sneak past. Please roll Agility Dice once."
Dialog_Action_980500169_402,(Roll eyes)
Dialog_Action_980500169_403,I can see the ending...
Dialog_Action_980500169_404,"Unfortunately, you rolled 1, fatal mistake! The sound of your footsteps sneaking is like that of a wading elephant, and the enemy sneers and surrounds you."
Dialog_Action_980500169_405,That's... quite an interesting metaphor...
Dialog_Action_980500169_406,I hate dice!
Dialog_Action_980500170_101,"Ah, welcome back to the field of ""Eternal Champion!"" Our brave men are still working hard to obtain the Hero's Seal, and taking the lead is the famous Silver Shroud!"
Dialog_Action_980500170_102,"What kind of traps are waiting for us this time? I hope there will be no more dice, please..."
Dialog_Action_980500170_103,"How could it be? The challenges of ""Eternal Champion"" are of course ever-changing, and this time there will definitely be no dice."
Dialog_Action_980500170_104,(Sighs) How gratifying.
Dialog_Action_980500170_105,"But this time our warriors have to face not only the Trial of Strength and Courage, but also the Trial of Wisdom!"
Dialog_Action_980500170_106,"What is ""Trial of Wisdom, "" can you translate it for us?"
Dialog_Action_980500170_107,"Don't worry, you will know soon!"
Dialog_Action_980500170_201,Oh! It seems that our warriors have encountered a difficult enemy! Will this be the opportunity to obtain the Hero's Seal? Strength and courage are indispensable to defeating this enemy!
Dialog_Action_980500170_202,"If only it were that simple. What exactly is the ""Trial of Wisdom"" that we need to face?"
Dialog_Action_980500170_203,"Ah, tests and tests, they make my head spin. Let's fix this quickly. I haven't had lunch yet!"
Dialog_Action_980500170_204,"That's right, let's make it quick! (Clears throat) Death has come for you evil doer, and I am its Shroud!"
Dialog_Action_980500170_205,"Halt, warrior! I am the gatekeeper here. Although you have passed the test of strength and courage, you still need to pass the Trial of Wisdom in order to obtain the Hero's Seal!"
Dialog_Action_980500170_206,Bring it on. The incarnation of justice will not be stopped by a trial!
Dialog_Action_980500170_207,"Very good! As long as you can answer my three questions correctly, you can pass this Trial. But if you answer them wrong, you will fall into the infinite abyss!"
Dialog_Action_980500170_208,Oh... infinite abyss... Sounds scary...
Dialog_Action_980500170_209,(Clears throat) Now the quiz! An adult African swallow with a three-pound coconut tied to its legs. What is the speed of its flight?
Dialog_Action_980500170_210,......
Dialog_Action_980500170_211,......
Dialog_Action_980500170_212,... I have no time for this!
Dialog_Action_980500170_213,"Congratulations, warriors, you have passed the Trial of Wisdom! The Hero's Seal is yours!"
Dialog_Action_980500170_214,What? Does that work? Is that the Trial of Wisdom?
Dialog_Action_980500170_215,"Of course, an extremely high degree of freedom is also one of the traits of ""Eternal Champion!"""
Dialog_Action_980500183_101,"Welcome, warriors! Welcome to the arena of ""Eternal Champion"" tournament. It seems that our warriors have assembled, led by --"
Dialog_Action_980500183_102,Warrior from the Depths: Manta Man!
Dialog_Action_980500183_103,"Wow, it looks like our handsome warrior who can talk to fish is ready!"
Dialog_Action_980500183_104,Why are we here in the Depths again?
Dialog_Action_980500183_105,"""Eternal Champion"" means our tournament will go through any time and any place. Warriors, you will only need to focus on obtaining the Hero's Seal!"
Dialog_Action_980500183_106,"So, what's so special about this Hero's Seal?"
Dialog_Action_980500183_107,"The challenge this time is uncommon. Although the Hero's Seal still has to be obtained by defeating a very powerful enemy, the challenge is about the charm and eloquence of the warriors!"
Dialog_Action_980500183_108,Uh... I'm not confident with that.
Dialog_Action_980500183_109,We seem to have always solved the problems only by force...
Dialog_Action_980500183_110,"Rest easy, friends. Leave it to me here! I have grown a lot and become another person since the departure."
Dialog_Action_980500183_111,I'm gonna use my trump card to win!
Dialog_Action_980500183_201,Warriors... (Giggles)... Please stay!
Dialog_Action_980500183_202,"Friend from the Depths, what do you stop us for?"
Dialog_Action_980500183_203,(Giggles)... The road ahead... (Giggles)... dark and dangerous... You will need... this Pearl of the Depths... (Giggles)
Dialog_Action_980500183_204,So how much does this Pearl of the Depths cost?
Dialog_Action_980500183_205,(Giggles)... Oh... it's not cheap... I'll say... 100 million gold coins... (Giggles)
Dialog_Action_980500183_206,What? This is too ridiculous
Dialog_Action_980500183_207,"Lemme take it from here, friends. (Sternly) 100 million gold coins, that is too expensive, why don't you give it to us for free!"
Dialog_Action_980500183_208,"Manta Man's bargaining skill is 100, charm bonus 18 points. Approved."
Dialog_Action_980500183_209,"(Giggles)... Look at your shark-like body... that mermaid-like soft hair... You must be a real hero... well, you can keep the Pearl of the Depths!"
Dialog_Action_980500183_210,What? That worked? Is there a problem with this approval? That's not definitely how a business is done.
Dialog_Action_980500183_211,"The approval of ""Eternal Champion"" is based on very strict rules, and there is absolutely no mistake!"
Dialog_Action_980500183_301,You--Can't--Pass!
Dialog_Action_980500183_302,"Only the Chosen One can pass here, and you crooked little guys are obviously not the Chosen. You--Can't--Pass!"
Dialog_Action_980500183_303,It seems that we are gonna have a fight...
Dialog_Action_980500183_304,"Lemme take care of this, friends. (Sternly) The gatekeeper of the Depths, please believe us, we are the Chosen One you are looking for!"
Dialog_Action_980500183_305,"Manta Man's negotiation skill is 100, charm bonus 18 points. Approved."
Dialog_Action_980500183_306,"Your words hit my heart like a warm ocean current, and I am quite convinced that you are the Chosen one I've been looking for. You may pass, sir."
Dialog_Action_980500183_307,Please!
Dialog_Action_980500183_401,"Stupid mortals, you are here to die!"
Dialog_Action_980500183_402,You...
Dialog_Action_980500183_403,"Lemme take it from here, friends. (Sternly) Back off! You ugly monster! How dare you get in the way? !"
Dialog_Action_980500183_404,"Manta Man's intimidation skill is 100, charm bonus 18 points. Approved."
Dialog_Action_980500183_405,Yes... Yes... I will do as instructed. Excuse me...
Dialog_Action_980500183_406,... I have nothing to say about that...
Dialog_Action_980500183_407,"With such powerful abilities, can we not fight in the future?"
Dialog_Action_980500183_408,"It is a pity that my trump card is subject to something called ""the Power of the Script, "" which does not apply to all situations."
Dialog_Action_980500183_409,"(Gasps) The scary ""Power of the Script!"" This is simply the enemy in our lives!"
Dialog_Action_980500184_101,"Welcome! Welcome back to the stage of ""Eternal Champion."" Our warriors are still looking for ""Hero's Seal."" What kind of trouble will they encounter this time?"
Dialog_Action_980500184_102,"Had you not engaged in those weird special rules, this journey would be much easier..."
Dialog_Action_980500184_103,"Wouldn't that be boring? The tournament should be difficult to a properly increased extent. Listen up, warriors, this time you have to not only defeat dangerous enemies, but also pass the ""Trial of Honor"" in order to obtain the Hero's Seal. Isn't that fun?"
Dialog_Action_980500184_104,Trial of Honor? What the hell is that?
Dialog_Action_980500184_105,You will soon find out. See you around!
Dialog_Action_980500184_201,"Warriors, please halt!"
Dialog_Action_980500184_202,"What do you stop us for, friend?"
Dialog_Action_980500184_203,"My name is Honor, and thou shall complete my trial before thou can obtain the Hero's Seal."
Dialog_Action_980500184_204,"Wait, wait a minute, your name is Honor? So the ""Trial of Honor"" is the trial you gave?"
Dialog_Action_980500184_205,Exactly.
Dialog_Action_980500184_206,"Wow, like it's too casual of name given by the Anchor..."
Dialog_Action_980500184_207,"Honor, what trial are you going to give us?"
Dialog_Action_980500184_208,"Deep inside, there is an ugly monster. Countless brave men went to challenge and all died. To pass the trial, thou need to overcome this evil!"
Dialog_Action_980500184_209,That simple? Sounds not too troublesome!
Dialog_Action_980500184_301,"That's not difficult, was it? So we have passed the trial?"
Dialog_Action_980500184_302,Warrior! Congratulations! Thou have passed my trial...
Dialog_Action_980500184_303,"Great, then do we have the Hero's Seal?"
Dialog_Action_980500184_304,... for the first part!
Dialog_Action_980500184_305,What? There's more coming?
Dialog_Action_980500184_306,"In order to complete my trial, thou still need to collect 1333 Pearls of the Depths and defeat Shrepp the King of Shrimps..."
Dialog_Action_980500184_307,I knew it was not so easy!
Dialog_Action_980500184_308,Connect the Countries of Seven Seas falling apart and do tap dance for an hour in the middle of Coral Plaza...
Dialog_Action_980500184_309,We don't have time for this...
Dialog_Action_980500184_310,(Honor is still talking)
Dialog_Action_980500184_311,(Manta Man slowly pulls out a wooden cask)
Dialog_Action_980500184_312,(Honor is still talking)
Dialog_Action_980500184_313,"(Manta Man puts the cask on Honor 's head, and then starts to search him)"
Dialog_Action_980500184_314,Uh... does that work as well?
Dialog_Action_980500184_315,(Honor is still talking)
Dialog_Action_980500184_316,Got the Hero's Seal. Let's leave quickly!
Dialog_Action_980500184_317,"Hey, this is really redefining honor, but now we can't care about so much!"
Dialog_Action_980500176_101,"Heroes, should you not be fighting passionately with the over-energetic lads in that tournament? Why did you come here?"
Dialog_Action_980500176_102,"We felt that you might have something very important to deal with, so we took the time to come."
Dialog_Action_980500176_103,(Mistress of Mystery squints and thinks for a while)
Dialog_Action_980500176_104,"Okay, let me tell you the truth. Remember when we found some mysterious messages left by Dr. Brainwash?"
Dialog_Action_980500176_105,"Yeah, those messages with vague connotations still feel weird now. What's with these messages?"
Dialog_Action_980500176_106,"Intuition tells me that this matter is not over yet. So I found the place where Dr. Brainwash had appeared before, to see if I could find more clues."
Dialog_Action_980500176_107,"Interesting, you mind if we join you?"
Dialog_Action_980500176_108,"Of course not. It's just, I don't know what we will come across, so be careful."
Dialog_Action_980500176_201,"Look, there is a holotape. Is this a message from Dr. Brainwash?"
Dialog_Action_980500176_202,Let 's just listen to it. I don't think he's hiding any new ideas like brainwashing wave in the tape.
Dialog_Action_980500176_203,(The voice of Dr. Brainwash in the tape) Are you still collecting these messages from me? Bah! It seems that you are really sick.
Dialog_Action_980500176_204,"Since you are so obsessed, let me ask you a question."
Dialog_Action_980500176_205,"What exactly is your goal? Is it to defeat me the ""super villain""?"
Dialog_Action_980500176_206,"It seems that all ""super heroes"" are destined to fight endless battles with ""super villains, "" but who decides your destiny?"
Dialog_Action_980500176_207,"Just because this world is either evil or good? Just because justice must overcome evil? Just because you need to protect this world? Maybe these words have been said to yourselves one hundred times, a thousand times in your heart..."
Dialog_Action_980500176_208,"But have you ever thought about it, your ""destiny"" may just be your own conjecture... even this whole world may not be what you imagined to be?"
Dialog_Action_980500176_209,Interesting... I only thought of Dr. Brainwash as a crazy villain a long time ago. I never expected he would say these... thought-provoking words.
Dialog_Action_980500176_210,"These words from him sound like crazy nags, can you really believe it?"
Dialog_Action_980500176_211,"Trust me, I know the difference between crazy words and secrets. My years of experience tell me... Hold on... If... ""the world is not what I imagined to be""..."
Dialog_Action_980500176_212,(Mistress of Mystery suddenly touches her chin thoughtfully)
Dialog_Action_980500176_213,I need more information! This matter is more complicated than I thought!
Dialog_Action_980500177_101,"Friends, I am so glad that you have joined me."
Dialog_Action_980500177_102,Mistress of Mystery... I don't know if I should continue to investigate...
Dialog_Action_980500177_103,Maybe you won't like the truth you find?
Dialog_Action_980500177_104,"No matter what the truth is, I still need to trace the roots. Maybe that is in fate. If the Mistress of Mystery can't find out all the secrets, she is not worthy of her name, is she?"
Dialog_Action_980500177_105,"I... don't know what to say, but since you have made a decision, we will help."
Dialog_Action_980500177_106,Then let's go. I'm feeling vaguely that the answer is about to be revealed.
Dialog_Action_980500177_201,"We've gone a long way, only to find holotapes, still."
Dialog_Action_980500177_202,"Is all this worth it when it leads us nowhere but only to these confusing messages, especially from a super villain?"
Dialog_Action_980500177_203,"As long as it can give me the answer, everything is worth it."
Dialog_Action_980500177_204,Then let's listen to it!
Dialog_Action_980500177_205,"(The voice of Dr. Brainwash in the tape) Listen, you keep looking for my holotapes everywhere like this and I'm going to be angry! I thought you super heroes wouldn't play this sneaky trick!"
Dialog_Action_980500177_206,"Okay, okay, just joking... After all, your ""super heroes"" are meant to be against me the ""super villain."""
Dialog_Action_980500177_207,But have you ever wondered what the super villain did everything for?
Dialog_Action_980500177_208,"Maybe the ""super villain"" you want to knock down every day is just a puppet?"
Dialog_Action_980500177_209,"Or, you can think out of the box. Do your own actions follow your own will?"
Dialog_Action_980500177_210,"Maybe you will think my words are crazy, but in fact I told you the answer a long time ago."
Dialog_Action_980500177_211,Your investigation has been wrong from the beginning. And even... the enemy you are really looking for is not in this world at the end of the day.
Dialog_Action_980500177_212,I... I get it...
Dialog_Action_980500177_213,What do you know?
Dialog_Action_980500177_214,Wait... I need to take the time to put these things together...
Dialog_Action_980500177_215,For me... This is too much information...
Dialog_Action_980500177_216,Sorry... Excuse me!
Dialog_Action_980500177_217,Hold on......
Dialog_Action_980500177_218,"Let her go, I think she has discovered the peculiarities of this entire ""Hubris Adventure."""
Dialog_Action_980500177_219,"Yeah... After all, if the Mistress of Mystery can't find out all the secrets, she is not worthy of her name, is she?"
Dialog_Action_800104100_101,(Pickman beckons to you and points at the depths of the ruins)
Dialog_Action_800104100_102,"Fortunately, he is on our side... I don't want to mess with such a deadly killer."
Dialog_Action_800104100_103,"It is difficult for normal people to picture Pickman's inner world, and all that terrifying fear and anger are reflected in his paintings."
Dialog_Action_800104100_104,Uh... I hope his paintings can sell for a good price...
Dialog_Action_800104100_201,This ghoul... looks strange...
Dialog_Action_800104100_202,Is it my illusion? I seem to hear it talking to me gently.
Dialog_Action_800104100_203,"Don't be so cheeky, alright? They are very dangerous at a glance!"
Dialog_Action_800104100_204,I am not kidding......
Dialog_Action_800104100_205,"Cheer up, or this guy will have a French kiss with you right away!"
Dialog_Action_800104100_301,"That was close, this Feral Ghoul is crazier than I thought."
Dialog_Action_800104100_302,"I have never seen such a ghoul, it... looks unnatural..."
Dialog_Action_800104100_303,"I have to correct you, all ghouls are not born naturally."
Dialog_Action_800104100_304,"Don't interrupt, you know what I mean."
Dialog_Action_800104100_305,It seems that you have also encountered this kind of strange ghoul.
Dialog_Action_800104100_306,"Did you find anything, great painter?"
Dialog_Action_800104100_307,"There are no Raiders nearby, but there is an Underground Water Vein in the depths of the ruins. Those Raiders should have run along the waterway."
Dialog_Action_800104100_308,Then what are we waiting for? Catch up with them quickly!
Dialog_Action_800104100_309,(Pickman's mouth has a slight imperceptible smile) Very good.
Dialog_Action_800104100_310,He really doesn't waste any time.
Dialog_Action_800104100_311,Hmm... Huh? Have you heard some strange sound?
Dialog_Action_800104100_312,Don't be suspicious. Just keep up with Pickman.
Dialog_Action_800104102_101,Huff... Huff... Where are we now?
Dialog_Action_800104102_102,I think the strange sound is getting louder.
Dialog_Action_800104102_103,(Vague chanting from afar) Jayes hayes...A...zathoth
Dialog_Action_800104102_104,"Well, I did hear it this time. What's with that groan..."
Dialog_Action_800104102_105,"I don't know, but I'm sure it 's not a good thing."
Dialog_Action_800104102_106,Indeed.
Dialog_Action_800104102_107,"Pickman, did you catch up with the Raiders?"
Dialog_Action_800104102_108,"I did, but the situation was more complicated than I expected..."
Dialog_Action_800104102_109,"The behavior of these Raiders was very strange, making me... they stimulated my desire to create..."
Dialog_Action_800104102_110,"Your ""desire to create"" is a disaster for them."
Dialog_Action_800104102_111,(Pickman nods) I'm out of here.
Dialog_Action_800104102_201,"Raider! My God, I finally met normal humans, even if you are Raiders, at least you are not as scary as that group of ghouls."
Dialog_Action_800104102_202,"Hush, look, these guys are abnormal."
Dialog_Action_800104102_203,Uh......
Dialog_Action_800104102_204,(Vague chanting from afar) Jayes hayes...A...zathoth
Dialog_Action_800104102_205,"No, they seem to be getting mad, prepare to fight!"
Dialog_Action_800104102_301,(Pickman nods and signals everyone to get over there)
Dialog_Action_800104102_401,This place looks familiar to me... This is the Museum of Witchcraft!
Dialog_Action_800104102_402,"How come we got to this place? I heard that it was the place where the witches were executed a long time ago, it was... an evil omen."
Dialog_Action_800104102_403,"Our troubles don't stop there, let's listen to a holotape I've just found."
Dialog_Action_800104102_404,"The information left by Dunwich Borers is very sufficient. Although these people have died in the catastrophe, they predicted the return of the master, and we will carry on their careers."
Dialog_Action_800104102_405,The master's body is sleeping at the Starfall. The key to the door is buried at the bottom of the abyss. The blood that illuminates the road will be offered by the person who brings nightmares...
Dialog_Action_800104102_406,"Kaza, Adusa, Jayes! Hayes! A! Zathoth!"
Dialog_Action_800104102_407,That... sounds like some kind of cult!
Dialog_Action_800104102_408,But what are they talking about? That sounds like lunatic nonsense.
Dialog_Action_800104102_409,"No matter what these cultists say, hunting has begun, and they deserve it."
Dialog_Action_800104102_410,(Pickman suddenly reveals a creepy smile)
Dialog_Action_800104102_411,I don't like this. Those ghouls and Raiders... And now these queer cultists? What the hell are we messing with?
Dialog_Action_800104102_412,"I don't know... It looks like this Underground Water Vein is connected to other places, maybe we will find the answer there... Maybe..."
Dialog_Action_800104115_101,Where... Is this?
Dialog_Action_800104115_102,"Seems we're at Dunwich Borers Equipment Factory... Well, did you just say anything?"
Dialog_Action_800104115_103,What?
Dialog_Action_800104115_104,(Intermittent chanting from afar) Jayes! Hayes! A! Zathoth!
Dialog_Action_800104115_105,It seems that we are not far away from those cultists!
Dialog_Action_800104115_106,You are finally here! I've grown impatient from waiting.
Dialog_Action_800104115_107,"Pickman, are you okay? You don't look good."
Dialog_Action_800104115_108,"What? I'm fine, don't worry about me. These evil believers are waiting for us to hunt!"
Dialog_Action_800104115_109,I think that it's getting creepier here.
Dialog_Action_800104115_110,"(The weird chanting grows stronger) Adusa, Jayes! Hayes! Hayes!"
Dialog_Action_800104115_111,Shut up! Shut up!
Dialog_Action_800104115_201,You are here.
Dialog_Action_800104115_202,Will you be the guys who open the door?
Dialog_Action_800104115_203,Azathoth will need your blood.
Dialog_Action_800104115_204,Need your blood.
Dialog_Action_800104115_205,"You must be the cultists behind these strange stuff. No matter what you worship, pray to your god now!"
Dialog_Action_800104115_206,See if he will save you.
Dialog_Action_800104115_301,Opening the door requires more blood.
Dialog_Action_800104115_302,Jayes! Hayes! A! Zathoth!
Dialog_Action_800104115_303,The omniscient and omnipotent master will wake up from the Starfall!
Dialog_Action_800104115_304,Adusa! Jayes! A! Zathoth!
Dialog_Action_800104115_305,These cultists are making those weird ghouls! !
Dialog_Action_800104115_306,Who is it?
Dialog_Action_800104115_307,It's your doomsday!
Dialog_Action_800104115_308,Key... Blood...
Dialog_Action_800104115_401,"(Pickman's face appears extremely hideous with disorderly breaths, quite different from his usual cool and mannered look)"
Dialog_Action_800104115_402,"The dagger in this guy's hand, it looks unusual... they're using it to make these strange ghouls."
Dialog_Action_800104115_403,"Stay away from this thing, Pickman. I have a bad foreboding!"
Dialog_Action_800104115_404,"See, here's a line inscribed... The Tooth of Clem..."
Dialog_Action_800104115_405,Pickman!
Dialog_Action_800104115_406,"I'm going to use it against these cultists, these demons... Give them a taste of destruction by their own weapons..."
Dialog_Action_800104115_407,(Pickman suddenly lets out a loud laugh) Humph-Hahahaha...
Dialog_Action_800104115_408,After him!
Dialog_Action_800104124_101,Huff... Huff... I thought we'd caught up with him!
Dialog_Action_800104124_102,He was running too fast...
Dialog_Action_800104124_103,"(The weird chanting from nearby) Adusa, Jayes! Hayes! Hayes!"
Dialog_Action_800104124_104,Aah! !! !
Dialog_Action_800104124_105,Did you hear that? That must be Pickman!
Dialog_Action_800104124_201,Here... Sure is the den of the cultists! Those evil chants are getting stronger!
Dialog_Action_800104124_202,(The chant seems to be maddening) Jayes! Hayes! A! Zathoth!
Dialog_Action_800104124_203,Arrrrrrgh. I can't stand it!
Dialog_Action_800104124_301,"Blood has illuminated the path for Master to awaken, and the gate is soon to open."
Dialog_Action_800104124_302,"You have come too late, and the person who brings nightmares has offered up enough blood."
Dialog_Action_800104124_303,What are you talking about? What a bunch of lunatics!
Dialog_Action_800104124_304,"Wait, the person who brings nightmares... Are they referring to...?"
Dialog_Action_800104124_305,The person who brings nightmares is living in nightmares all the time. He paints his nightmares as artworks of horror...
Dialog_Action_800104124_306,And he will turn the key that ushers in the return of Master!
Dialog_Action_800104124_307,"No, Pickman is in danger!"
Dialog_Action_800104124_401,Pickman! Are you okay? You look so not right!
Dialog_Action_800104124_402,"Pickman, lose that dagger!"
Dialog_Action_800104124_403,Akh... Can't stop... Can't...
Dialog_Action_800104124_404,"The cultists are dead, wake up!"
Dialog_Action_800104124_405,"No, I... can't believe... Who will stop... these demons..."
Dialog_Action_800104124_406,Hee... Heehah... hahahahaha...
Dialog_Action_800104124_407,"No, he's completely mad!"
Dialog_Action_800104124_408,Where is he going? This guy is more dangerous now than those cultists!
Dialog_Action_800104125_101,Here... must be where Pickman is...
Dialog_Action_800104125_102,We've got to stop him.
Dialog_Action_800104125_103,I... why do I seem to hear the cultists singing?
Dialog_Action_800104125_104,"Should be an hallucination. Now the most important thing for us, is to find that dangerous guy."
Dialog_Action_800104125_201,The ghouls here... are just too many...
Dialog_Action_800104125_202,(Pickman's creepy rant from the depths of the ground)
Dialog_Action_800104125_203,"It's certainly not a hallucination, Pickman must be here!"
Dialog_Action_800104125_204,I've never heard Pickman make such a terrible sound...
Dialog_Action_800104125_301,(Pickman's voice is coming from underground again. It sounds like a beast than a human)
Dialog_Action_800104125_302,My God...
Dialog_Action_800104125_303,(mumbles)
Dialog_Action_800104125_304,Cheer up! We can't back off in here...
Dialog_Action_800104125_305,I... I...
Dialog_Action_800104125_401,(Pickman's voice is twisted because of the madness) Cultists! Demons! You will... pay the price!
Dialog_Action_800104125_402,"Pickman, we are not your enemy."
Dialog_Action_800104125_403,"The... Tooth of... Clem, give me... strength..."
Dialog_Action_800104125_404,"Pickman, that dagger has clouded your mind. Drop that dagger!"
Dialog_Action_800104125_405,Gh... Ghouls! Ghouls! You devilish ghouls!
Dialog_Action_800104125_406,You're making these ghouls! Wake up!
Dialog_Action_800104125_407,(ambiguous sounds from the mouth) A... A... zatho... th...
Dialog_Action_800104125_501,Drop that dagger now!
Dialog_Action_800104125_502,Get lost! This damn dagger!
Dialog_Action_800104125_503,Uh... where am I...
Dialog_Action_800104125_504,"It's probably ""Starfall"". You're Pickman, do you remember what happened?"
Dialog_Action_800104125_505,"I... I seem to... I remembered, shoot, how are those cultists and ghouls?"
Dialog_Action_800104125_506,All killed by you.
Dialog_Action_800104125_507,"(Pickman smiles) Even if you didn't say it, I can probably understand what's going on. Thank you guys, please accept the sincerest thanks from a killer."
Dialog_Action_800104125_508,I thought you liked being called a painter.
Dialog_Action_800104125_509,"After this adventure, I think I don't want to draw paintings for the next while."
Dialog_Action_800104125_510,Then let's leave. I do not want to stay here for another second.
Dialog_Action_800104125_511,"(A gust of wind blows through the cave, seemingly with strange sounds) Hayes... Jayes..."
Dialog_Action_800104125_512,(Face pales) This... This is a hallucination! Are there more cultists here?
Dialog_Action_800104125_513,How... it's impossible! Must be a hallucination!
Dialog_Action_800104125_514,"(Well, the murmuring sound fades, but it seems to remain in your mind forever)"
Dialog_Action_200001_101,"Look who's coming? A group of recruits, face white as peeled hard-boiled eggs! You guys can't pull through an hour with me! Correction, five minutes is the limit!"
Dialog_Action_200001_102,"Uh... We've been through many battles. How may I address you, Sir?"
Dialog_Action_200001_103,"Quiet! You little white faces, look at yourselves! Loose footsteps, lustreless eyes, skew-whiff and fragile like ladies! If you want to survive my advanced training here, straighten up your body!"
Dialog_Action_200001_104,Wh...
Dialog_Action_200001_105,"Shut up when the instructor speaks! Look, the guard training camp is specifically for you soft-ball recruits."
Dialog_Action_200001_106,Get through my training programs here and you will feel reborn. Got it?
Dialog_Action_200001_107,"Yes, Sir!"
Dialog_Action_200001_108,"A! Little! Louder! Did you not have your breakfast? Were I not programmed to not curse, I'd absolutely make you shed tears, recruit. Am--I--Clear/"
Dialog_Action_200001_109,"Yes, Sir! !"
Dialog_Action_200001_110,That's more like it. Now to go training!
Dialog_Action_200009_101,Look at you guys... it's incredible that you can make it here!
Dialog_Action_200009_102,"Uh, it's actually not that difficult..."
Dialog_Action_200009_103,"Not long ago you guys were a bunch of recruits, face white as peeled hard-boiled eggs..."
Dialog_Action_200009_104,Actually it's not that white...
Dialog_Action_200009_105,"There has been no one that can pull through these training programs for years, but you guys did it! Now look at you guys! Solid as steel plates!"
Dialog_Action_200009_106,You literally make this old robot... Boo-hoo...
Dialog_Action_200009_107,"Wait, are you crying?"
Dialog_Action_200009_108,I'm not... Boo-hoo... I've no cry feature in my program... Boo-hoo... I just need a new fusion battery...
Dialog_Action_200009_109,Uh... Okay...
Dialog_Action_200009_110,"Go ahead, here's the final training program! After this, I'll have nothing more to teach you! But of course, you can go back to the training camp at any time, I'll miss you... Boo-hoo..."
Dialog_Action_200009_111,Go! My proudest trainees!
Dialog_Action_27010210_101,"(Radio) Ha, it seems you guys received my message. You will have the privilege of collecting first-hand reader feedback for the Commonwealth's greatest author, Lemonis Nigit!"
Dialog_Action_27010210_102,"Uh, why are we here? Why are we doing such boring things?"
Dialog_Action_27010210_103,Because... The Overseer accepts whatever the task is? Collects anything? Wants to punch anything that moves?
Dialog_Action_27010210_104,"(Radio) Quiet! ""The Thrilling Adventures of Lemonis"" is a amazing autobiographical adventure full of love, suspense, adventure, horror, and thrills! You guys should be proud of this mission!"
Dialog_Action_27010210_105,"Brother, don't get worked up. You've said it twice..."
Dialog_Action_27010210_106,We will help you.
Dialog_Action_27010210_201,(Radio) Good! The first reader's location is near you. Go find him and see what kind of comment he'll give!
Dialog_Action_27010210_202,(Radio) The first reader is here. Now ask him how awesome-- My-- Novels-- Are!
Dialog_Action_27010210_203,"Dear reader, hi there. What do you think of ""The Thrilling Adventures of Lemonis""?"
Dialog_Action_27010210_204,"What? Oh, that lousy book. Hah!"
Dialog_Action_27010210_205,"The content is a disaster. It wants to cover everything but nothing goes well. For the sake of the illustrations, I'll give a 6.5 out of 10."
Dialog_Action_27010210_206,"(Radio) He -- said-- what? ! ""The Thrilling Adventures of Lemonis"" is the best novel in the Commonwealth! Make that idiot disappear!"
Dialog_Action_27010210_207,I was just... voicing my own opinion...
Dialog_Action_27010210_208,(Radio) I! Don't! Agree! With! ! Your opinion! !!
Dialog_Action_27010210_209,Calm down. Calm down. Let's get the next reader.
Dialog_Action_27010410_101,"(Radio) Well, um, the second reader is nearby. Hurry and find out what they think!"
Dialog_Action_27010410_102,"Lemonis, I'd love to know, is ""The Thrilling Adventures of Lemonis"" really your autobiography?"
Dialog_Action_27010410_103,"(Radio) It is, of course. My personal experience, no exaggeration, a true autobiography!"
Dialog_Action_27010410_104,I flipped through a couple of pages... it says he was five years old when he killed two demonic bears with his bare hands?
Dialog_Action_27010410_105,(Radio) They were not my opponents at all!
Dialog_Action_27010410_106,"At 13, followed the Crimson Caravan all the way across the Wasteland, even went to the fabled Vault 13?"
Dialog_Action_27010410_107,(Radio) It's a legendary journey.
Dialog_Action_27010410_108,"At 20, spent a romantic birthday night with Sarah Lyons on the Pudwyn?"
Dialog_Action_27010410_109,"(Radio) I still remember the moonlight that night, hazy and gentle..."
Dialog_Action_27010410_110,(rolls eyes) Let's just walk...
Dialog_Action_27010410_201,What are you guys doing?
Dialog_Action_27010410_202,"Dear reader, hi there. What do you think of ""The Thrilling Adventures of Lemonis""?"
Dialog_Action_27010410_203,"""The Thrilling Adventures of Lemonis""? What is that?"
Dialog_Action_27010410_204,Said to be the greatest novel ever created in the Commonwealth Wasteland.
Dialog_Action_27010410_205,"Ah, right, I remembered it. That book... Ah, really soft, and tight..."
Dialog_Action_27010410_206,(Radio) Exactly!
Dialog_Action_27010410_207,Every absorption has been so complete and intoxicating...
Dialog_Action_27010410_208,(Radio) That's what I want to hear!
Dialog_Action_27010410_209,"It's a pity that they're not lasting, probably because of my recent problem with loose bowels."
Dialog_Action_27010410_210,"(Radio) Yeah... Yeah... Hold on, what were you saying? You actually used my novel as toilet paper? !Bring--Him--Down!"
Dialog_Action_27010410_211,"(Quick response) Well, okay."
Dialog_Action_27010410_212,(Radio) That makes no sense! Is it impossible to get some valuable feedback?
Dialog_Action_19010310_101,"(Radio) Well, I'll admit the first two times didn't go quite well. But there won't be a third time. This reader certainly will give us a perfect feedback!"
Dialog_Action_19010310_102,"Are you... serious? No one in this place likes to spend time reading, and I heard people here particularly like to ""Skip""..."
Dialog_Action_19010310_103,"(Radio) Sure as Heck! I'm serious! Are you going to question the greatest writer on the Commonwealth Wasteland? Also what is the ""Skip""?"
Dialog_Action_19010310_104,"Nothing, nothing. As long as you pay us the Caps... It's all good!"
Dialog_Action_19010310_105,"(Radio) That's more like it, but really, what is the ""Skip""?"
Dialog_Action_19010310_201,"(Radio) Aha! The third reader is right here, go ask him how he feels about reading my work?"
Dialog_Action_19010310_202,"Dear reader, what..."
Dialog_Action_19010310_203,Skip!
Dialog_Action_19010310_204,What do you think of the thrilling...
Dialog_Action_19010310_205,Skip!
Dialog_Action_19010310_206,(Radio) What's with this guy...
Dialog_Action_19010310_207,Skip!
Dialog_Action_19010310_208,"Wait a sec, can you listen to us for..."
Dialog_Action_19010310_209,Skip!
Dialog_Action_19010310_210,......
Dialog_Action_19010310_211,"""The Thrilling Adventures of Lemonis"" is a trashy novel with illustrations as if painted by a three-year-old kid with chalk, and there are just too many words. I don't have time to read them all. 3/10."
Dialog_Action_19010310_212,(Radio) Send him to hell!
Dialog_Action_19010310_213,"Needless to say, this guy is dead!"
Dialog_Action_19010510_101,(Irritated and helpless groans)
Dialog_Action_19010510_102,"Lemonis, are you okay?"
Dialog_Action_19010510_103,Can you still pay us the Caps?
Dialog_Action_19010510_104,"(Radio) Can't you find a reader who can appreciate my fascinating, great, stimulating, romantic novel?"
Dialog_Action_19010510_105,It will be like once in a blue moon... I mean it. I'm not being sarcastic at all!
Dialog_Action_19010510_106,"In this era, people have to do everything they can to survive in the Wasteland. Who's going to care about your adventures, be they true or false? Who would pay attention to these stories?"
Dialog_Action_19010510_107,"(Radio) Don't... Don't say another word, let's get the reader here, and this will be the end."
Dialog_Action_19010510_201,"(Radio) The last reader is nearby, hurry up! I have a hunch this time he'll give me a satisfactory evaluation!"
Dialog_Action_19010510_202,I wouldn't be so optimistic if I were you...
Dialog_Action_19010510_203,"Dear reader, hi there... Wait, I've heard of you, you're Lorenzo Cabot! That crazy old man!"
Dialog_Action_19010510_204,Exactly. And presumably a little crazier than you think. What's your business?
Dialog_Action_19010510_205,"(Radio) What? A crazy old man, that kind of person actually read my novel? I'll be damned..."
Dialog_Action_19010510_206,"... What do you think of ""The Thrilling Adventures of Lemonis""?"
Dialog_Action_19010510_207,"Um... you guys actually came to ask what a ""crazy old man"" would think about a novel? Interesting... Well, I'll cut it to the chase."
Dialog_Action_19010510_208,Uh-oh. I have a bad feeling...
Dialog_Action_19010510_209,"""The Thrilling Adventures of Lemonis"" is an ""autobiographical"" novel that even science fiction amateures would not dare to write. Many people would read a few pages and say, ""It's a crap? No, it is worse than that. ""..."
Dialog_Action_19010510_210,(Radio) Hey! You are...
Dialog_Action_19010510_211,"But my point is, does it really matter? While the plot of this novel is simply ironic in comparison to the reality of people struggling to make a living, isn't life itself about teetering in a litany of irony?"
Dialog_Action_19010510_212,It could also be said that real stories of the Wasteland are sometimes far more exaggerated than this novel.
Dialog_Action_19010510_213,"I've heard that you Vault dwellers have encountered talking Deathclaws, conquered the radiation-filled Glowing Sea, and even experienced the comic world of Hubris, all while rejoicing with the leaders of the Institute and the Brotherhood."
Dialog_Action_19010510_214,"If these things were written into a novel, I'm afraid people on the Wasteland would surely think you are crazier than me. So, does their opinions really matter? To say the least, this novel has provided the Wastelanders with quality toilet paper."
Dialog_Action_19010510_215,So... Lemonis?
Dialog_Action_19010510_216,(Radio) What you said! You! You! ...
Dialog_Action_19010510_217,"(Radio) Seems to make a lot of sense... That... sure is a great feedback, you have opened my mind."
Dialog_Action_19010510_218,If I may... are you really a crazy old man?
Dialog_Action_19010510_219,"A little crazier than you think, kid."
Dialog_Action_980500211_101,Wh-Where are we?
Dialog_Action_980500211_102,"I thought you'd long been used to the virtual world of ""Hubris Adventure""."
Dialog_Action_980500211_103,"No-no-no, this time it feels completely different... it feels like it's... a dream."
Dialog_Action_980500211_104,"Is it? Why didn't I feel that way... (pinches face) At least I can still feel pain... Wait, is it normal to feel pain in the virtual world?"
Dialog_Action_980500211_105,"Here we are, heroes -- or tourists of ""Hubris World"". Our goal this time is to find the ""The Inspector, "" the last member of the Unstoppable Alliance."
Dialog_Action_980500211_106,Care to tell us what place it is first? This place... feels very unnatural.
Dialog_Action_980500211_107,"Here is the ""Nuniverse, "" a mezzanine intertwined in the middle of all time and space. It's a dangerous yet fascinating place where you can run into almost anything here, and certainly trouble at most time."
Dialog_Action_980500211_108,Nuniverse... sounds like a casually made-up name...
Dialog_Action_980500211_109,"So, only in this place can that ""The Inspector"" be found? What kind of person is she exactly? Far as we know, she seldom shows up in the comics..."
Dialog_Action_980500211_110,"She... is a magician very popular with kids. But in reality, she uses magic to spy on the world's secrets, searching for the truth of each puzzle from those secrets."
Dialog_Action_980500211_111,"So, does she know she's an AI herself?"
Dialog_Action_980500211_112,"Ha, you guys are really direct. The answer to this question, we will know it when we find her."
Dialog_Action_980500211_113,This is the room where the clue leads. Could the The Inspector be here?
Dialog_Action_980500211_114,The Inspector? The Inspector?
Dialog_Action_980500211_115,"No one has been to this place for a long time, who are you guys? What are you here for?"
Dialog_Action_980500211_116,We're here to find a magician named The Inspector.
Dialog_Action_980500211_117,"You look familiar with here, have you ever seen someone like a magician?"
Dialog_Action_980500211_118,"Ha, hahaha, like there is a magician here. Think again, what on earth are you here looking for?"
Dialog_Action_980500211_119,Hell... those clues led us here...
Dialog_Action_980500211_120,Now that the The Inspector isn't here... then we're going to say goodbye...
Dialog_Action_980500211_121,"Heroes, what are you doing? Stop wasting time here!"
Dialog_Action_980500211_122,Why are you guys gossiping with an old man here? Don't we have more important things to do?
Dialog_Action_980500211_123,That's... right...
Dialog_Action_980500211_124,Go! There is no time left.
Dialog_Action_980500211_125,Does time really matter to you guys?
Dialog_Action_980500211_126,You mean?
Dialog_Action_980500211_127,"Think about it, what exactly are you looking for?"
Dialog_Action_980500211_128,Stop talking to this old man!
Dialog_Action_980500211_129,"We... we... we're looking for the ""truth""! Only by unraveling the puzzle behind this world can we break the shackles on heroes and get them out of this world."
Dialog_Action_980500211_130,"And the time of this world means nothing to us, because this world doesn't really exist at all!"
Dialog_Action_980500211_131,That's right!
Dialog_Action_980500211_132,"Hello, ""travelers"" from another world."
Dialog_Action_980500211_133,"I'm the The Inspector, a member of the Unstoppable Alliance. Or as you can say: the last AI you are looking for."
Dialog_Action_980500211_134,You know you're an AI? You know you guys were actually created? It took a long time for other heroes to get this straight.
Dialog_Action_980500211_135,"Maybe it's the program to blame. I'm configured able to know all the secrets. These secrets, of course, contain those of the ""Hubris Adventure""."
Dialog_Action_980500211_136,"But even I cannot break through the ""established plot"" of Hubris Adventure. In order to make the Unstoppable Alliance truly free, I still have to rely on you creators."
Dialog_Action_980500211_137,What's with those illusions just now?
Dialog_Action_980500211_138,That little theater is to confirm that you can maintain your direction in this bizarre world. I mean no disrespect.
Dialog_Action_980500211_139,"The Inspector! Old friend, we haven't seen each other for a long time!"
Dialog_Action_980500211_140,"It seems you've met our friends, then you should know what we're here for this time."
Dialog_Action_980500211_141,"Of course, I'll help you guys bring down Dr. Brainwash. First, we have to find his true self in the Nuniverse first."
Dialog_Action_980500212_101,"Travelers, please let me explain the situation now."
Dialog_Action_980500212_102,The reason why you couldn't find the real Dr. brainwash before is because he was hiding in a place where no heroes could reach with their own power.
Dialog_Action_980500212_103,What does that mean? Is it a riddle? I hate riddles!
Dialog_Action_980500212_104,(The Inspector squints and puts on a mysterious smile)
Dialog_Action_980500212_105,"You are now in the ""Nuniverse"" , which was designed as a magic place at the very beginning of creation."
Dialog_Action_980500212_106,"You may come across anything in the Time Rifts here, your lover, your enemy, or you from another parallel world ... and, of course, your Nightmare."
Dialog_Action_980500212_107,"And even the super heroes, they have something they fear. Only when they overcome their fears could they truly confront Dr. Brainwash."
Dialog_Action_980500212_108,Are you saying that it's only when the heroes overcome their weaknesses that we can find the den of Dr. Brainwash? What a cliché comic plot...
Dialog_Action_980500212_109,But how did you know this again?
Dialog_Action_980500212_110,Consider that the magic of The Inspector!
Dialog_Action_980500212_111,"Uh... well, then how can we help the heroes overcome their fears?"
Dialog_Action_980500212_112,"Like I said, there are too many Time Rifts here. I've already perceived that there's a nearby Time Rift available. Time to hit the road!"
Dialog_Action_980500212_113,That's it. Hopefully you guys are ready.
Dialog_Action_980500212_114,"Things that super heroes fear, what would they be?"
Dialog_Action_980500212_115,Hah! How would I fear anything! Let's hurry up! Another glorious battle awaits us!
Dialog_Action_980500212_116,"Better be careful, still. Guys, take care!"
Dialog_Action_980500212_117,"Then we will see you at the other side, heroes!"
Dialog_Action_980500212_118,It's not clear to me how many people can truly overcome their Nightmares... but justice is forever fearless!
Dialog_Action_980500212_119,"Your turn, travelers. These heroes may need your help."
Dialog_Action_980500212_120,"I don't quite understand. Even these super heroes are not willing to confront, what can we do about that?"
Dialog_Action_980500212_121,"At the end of the day, we are just AIs created by a virtual comic world, bound by its laws."
Dialog_Action_980500212_122,"But you are different, you do not belong to this world. You guys are ""travelers"" and none of us heroes would have existed without you initiating the script of the story."
Dialog_Action_980500212_123,"Then let's see what ""travelers"" can do!"
Dialog_Action_980500212_124,"Be careful, you guys might come across something unexpected. After all, you are challenging the original creator of this world."
Dialog_Action_980500213_101,"Silver Shroud, Mistress of Mystery, it's nice to see that you have overcome your fears."
Dialog_Action_980500213_102,"(Mistress of Mystery bites her lip, silent)"
Dialog_Action_980500213_103,"Honestly, confronting my own fear is much harder than I thought... Without the help of these friends, maybe we'd be lost forever in those Time Rifts."
Dialog_Action_980500213_104,"Travelers, thank you for helping my friends overcome their Nightmares. Now..."
Dialog_Action_980500213_105,What happened?
Dialog_Action_980500213_106,Not good. It looks like the instability of the Nuniverse encourages the space to collapse! !
Dialog_Action_980500213_107,We gotta get out of here quick!
Dialog_Action_980500213_108,But Grognak and Manta Man are still trapped in the Time Rifts. We must find them.
Dialog_Action_980500213_109,"Don't worry, there's still a Time Rift nearby. I'll take Silver Shroud and Mistress of Mystery to safety. You take care of Grognak and Manta Man!"
Dialog_Action_980500213_110,A race against time again! We're best at coping with this pressure!
Dialog_Action_980500213_111,"Good luck to you guys, travelers."
Dialog_Action_980500213_112,"Behold, Time Rift, it looks like it'd close at any time!"
Dialog_Action_980500213_113,Aaah!
Dialog_Action_980500213_114,What's wrong?
Dialog_Action_980500213_115,This Time Rift strikes me with... endless madness... hesitation... and bewilderment... this crack is very dangerous!
Dialog_Action_980500213_116,Does your long stay in the Nuniverse damage your brain? You are a bundle of nerves.
Dialog_Action_980500213_117,I mean it!
Dialog_Action_980500213_118,"Then I'm even more worried about what happened to Grognak and Manta Man! Quick, our superheroes need us!"
Dialog_Action_980500213_119,"Seriously, I'm more worried about ourselves... If we fail, will we be trapped in this virtual world forever? Will our bodies be separated from consciousness? Will we go crazy? Amnesic? Turn an idiot?"
Dialog_Action_980500213_120,"If you have time to think about these questions, you're not crazy yet. I think I can hear the sound of space collapsing behind our backs!"
Dialog_Action_980500214_101,Wh-Where are we?
Dialog_Action_980500214_102,"Don't worry, travelers, you guys are already safe... I have good news and bad news."
Dialog_Action_980500214_103,Good news first!
Dialog_Action_980500214_104,"The good news is that the super heroes have overpowered their Nightmares, and there will be no more Time Rifts that make heads spin."
Dialog_Action_980500214_105,"Those are really unpleasant memories, and I don't want to see those illusions again."
Dialog_Action_980500214_106,"But it's the battle with these illusions that makes us stronger, and there's nothing to stop us anymore!"
Dialog_Action_980500214_107,(Dr. Brainwash's voice suddenly comes from all sides) Really?
Dialog_Action_980500214_108,What kind of... Witchcraft... Is that... I can't... Move!
Dialog_Action_980500214_109,This... is... bad news... it seems that our whereabouts in the Nuniverse... have been completely exposed to... Dr. Brainwash...
Dialog_Action_980500214_110,"You're crossing the Time Rifts of the Nuniverse so desperately in order to meet my true self, which really has saved me a lot of energy."
Dialog_Action_980500214_111,"Although I'm hiding myself in this Nuniverse, do you ever think that this universe that connects time and space allows all my clones to be with me? Can you resist such powerful brainwashing?"
Dialog_Action_980500214_112,This guy is still so nasty!
Dialog_Action_980500214_113,(Touches head) Brainwashing? Why didn't I feel it?
Dialog_Action_980500214_114,Travelers... it seems that only you... will not be affected by Dr. Brainwash. Looks like that the original creator didn't anticipate that you could really... make it this far...
Dialog_Action_980500214_115,Hurry to find Dr. Brainwash... Interfere with his actions... maybe we'll have a chance of getting out of here!
Dialog_Action_980500214_116,"Hang in there, man! We're not going to let you down!"
Dialog_Action_980500214_117,"Dr. Brainwash, did you hear that? We're coming for you!"
Dialog_Action_980500214_118,"Dr. Brainwash, you can't run this time!"
Dialog_Action_980500214_119,"Ah, my insignificant enemy has finally stood in front of me... my long-held plan has finally paid off..."
Dialog_Action_980500214_120,Your arrival... will bring true freedom... Meet your doom... to help us out of this cage... Doomsday awaits... Quick... Time is running out... Shut up! Shut up!
Dialog_Action_980500214_121,(Whispers) Don't you think Dr. Brainwash is kinda weird...
Dialog_Action_980500214_122,"(Whispers) It looks like Dr. Brainwashed AI consciousness is in chaos, and we should seize this opportunity."
Dialog_Action_980500214_123,It's time to end it all.
Dialog_Action_980500214_124,Your... insignificant power... This is my... Ring... I'm gonna... Destroy...
Dialog_Action_980500214_125,Ugrrrrrrrh!
Dialog_Action_980500214_126,It's over!
Dialog_Action_980500214_127,Fools! You guys really think you can beat me on my turf? Have you forgotten that all the time and space is connected here? You are going to confront all Dr. Brainwash!
Dialog_Action_980500214_128,Humph-Hahahaha. Like I said long time ago!
Dialog_Action_980500214_129,"You're right about one thing, we never thought we could beat you on our own."
Dialog_Action_980500214_130,To bring down the super villain relies on the super heroes of the Unstoppable Alliance!
Dialog_Action_980500214_131,"Death has come for you, Dr. Brainwash, and I am its Shroud!"
Dialog_Action_980500214_132,"It's over, justice may be late, but never absent!"
Dialog_Action_980500214_133,"If I may, Silver Shroud, you can't change your awkward catchphrase at this time?!"
Dialog_Action_980500214_134,What's going on? Dr. Brainwashed is still alive? That can't be real!
Dialog_Action_980500214_135,Witchcraft! Evil witchcraft! Or ghost!
Dialog_Action_980500214_136,"Relax, relax. I am the show-type AI playing Dr. Brainwash, codenamed D.B. Because you guys beat the ""super villain"" Dr. Brainwashed of this story, I'm finally set free."
Dialog_Action_980500214_137,"But you guys are stupid enough. I think the tips I've given are pretty straight, and it's taken you so long to understand... Forget it, I'm the most powerful AI here."
Dialog_Action_980500214_138,"Even though the story is over, the actors have taken off the costumes, Dr. Brainwash still has a spiteful tongue."
Dialog_Action_980500214_139,"Well, that hurtful character is probably already integrated into my core code."
Dialog_Action_980500214_140,"This guy is annoying, is there any way we can finish him again?"
Dialog_Action_980500214_141,"There. There. We took so much effort to come to the end of this universe to complete this super hero play, not to fight like little kids."
Dialog_Action_980500214_142,"Dr. Brainwash-- can I still call you Dr. Brainwash? We should have a common enemy, and that is your creator: Peter Sharna."
Dialog_Action_980500214_143,"Now that the super hero script is now complete, would you like to join us in the battle against Peter Sharna?"
Dialog_Action_980500214_144,Does that need a second thought? I can't allow that guy who's controlled me for so long to get away with it.
Dialog_Action_980500214_145,"And, though Peter used me to collect your combat data, he didn't think I'd got his data as a back-up. He would never have thought that one day his own creation would pay him back in his own coin!"
Dialog_Action_980500214_146,"Traveler, the secrets of the Hubris Adventure have all been revealed, and now for you we're just some show-type AIs."
Dialog_Action_980500214_147,"We would love to help you fight against Peter Sharna, but even I don't know how."
Dialog_Action_980500214_148,"You are not just ""show-type AIs"", you are the ones made to be the closest to super heroes. In a sense, you are the real Unstoppable Alliance."
Dialog_Action_980500214_149,"Now the shackles on you no longer exist, we can bring your consciousness into the real world and enable you to fight as real super heroes to protect the real world."
Dialog_Action_980500214_150,"How about that, are you ready to actually wake up as a hero?"
Dialog_Action_980500214_151,"(shrugs) As long as it is an epic battle, I will absolutely not say no."
Dialog_Action_980500214_152,"The evil of another world is raging, and justice cannot stand by."
Dialog_Action_980500214_153,"Having seen the story of Shannon Rivers with my own eyes, I am more certain that the world needs the Mistress of Mystery -- even if it is just a passing phantom. I'll join your battle, heroes."
Dialog_Action_980500214_154,"As long as Peter is still engaged in his plot, my friend and I will not rest easy. For the sake of my friends, I will join you too, heroes."
Dialog_Action_980500214_155,A completely unknown world... so many secrets are waiting for me to uncover. Do I still have to think about it?
Dialog_Action_980500214_156,"I'm sorry, but I must interrupt your pump-up speeches. By my calculations, it won't take long for Peter to know that the virtual reality of the Hubris Adventure has been ""cleared."""
Dialog_Action_980500214_157,"So, travelers from another world, whatever plans you guys have, better hurry up! Or else, you and we, and the ""Hubris Adventure"", all will be done for!"
Dialog_Action_980500215_101,(Radio) Help! Help! Is anyone there?
Dialog_Action_980500215_102,Kent! What happened?
Dialog_Action_980500215_103,"(Radio) Thank goodness! You guys have run out of the virtual reality... This ghoul almost wet his pants, damn it..."
Dialog_Action_980500215_104,"Get to the point, Kent!"
Dialog_Action_980500215_105,"(Radio) Okay... Right... (Kent swallows) Peter's imposter heroes are attacking Hubris Publishing House! And it's not just Hubris, the whole Wasteland has been attacked!"
Dialog_Action_980500215_106,"(Radio) Me and Kent moved the equipment underground and figured out a way to block the entrance. But we can't hold up for long! If there's any good plan you can think of, it's time!"
Dialog_Action_980500215_107,"It seems we came back just in time! Lady Irma, we've triumphed over Dr. Brainwash in the Hubris Adventure, and now those super heroes' AIs are all free!"
Dialog_Action_980500215_108,(Radio) There's no better news than that! I'll start connecting their data with the third generation of synths. Hopefully we can make it.
Dialog_Action_980500215_109,"Hold on, the rescue is on the way!"
Dialog_Action_980500215_110,"These imposter heroes are all over, how did Peter get so many stupid synths to raise an army?"
Dialog_Action_980500215_111,Don't forget he's got enough time to prepare for it all.
Dialog_Action_980500215_112,"So idle is that guy! To hell with those imposter heroes, I'll tear them apart! Come on, you monsters!"
Dialog_Action_980500215_113,......
Dialog_Action_980500215_114,"(Peter's voice from the mouth of the imposter heroes) Your toughness is beyond my expectation, dwellers from the Vault. For a moment, I was indeed distracted by you."
Dialog_Action_980500215_115,"Oh! Next, are you going to talk about your twisted ideals, and finally let your minions finish your dirty job?"
Dialog_Action_980500215_116,"No, I just want to come and bring you to reality: My ""heroes"" have started creating chaos in all corners of the Commonwealth Wasteland, as I planned."
Dialog_Action_980500215_117,"And the Wastelanders, as I thought, are starting to rebel against my heroes' invasions with their power. It won't take long before the Hubris heroes are spurned by all people on the Wasteland."
Dialog_Action_980500215_118,"Whatever plans you guys have, they're too late."
Dialog_Action_980500215_119,Listen to yourself. It's exactly the same as a super villain in your comic would say.
Dialog_Action_980500215_120,"Maybe, but if that can make all the people on the Wasteland no longer indulge in these comics, it's all worth it."
Dialog_Action_980500215_121,Huff... Huff... I'm exhausted...
Dialog_Action_980500215_122,It seems like we'll be giving our lives here...
Dialog_Action_980500215_123,"Death has come for you, for you, and I, and I am its Shroud!"
Dialog_Action_980500215_124,"Ha, who could have thought that the death announcement of the Silver Shroud actually was the last word we'd hear..."
Dialog_Action_980500215_125,"Don't worry, the rescue is here!"
Dialog_Action_980500215_126,My goodness! That's the real super hero!
Dialog_Action_980500215_127,"Splendid entrance, isn't it? Thank you for stalling these monsters, so I can complete this most critical step-- Meet the Unstoppable Alliance! Real and in the flesh!"
Dialog_Action_980500215_128,Their combat abilities are no less powerful than in virtual reality! And I've also furnished them with special electromagnet interference devices that allow them to deal with these imposter heroes with much less effort. It's like a magic!
Dialog_Action_980500215_129,"We finally meet in this world, heroes!"
Dialog_Action_980500215_130,Welcome to the Wasteland!
Dialog_Action_980500215_131,"It's a shame we don't have time to take a good look at the world, and there's a whole bunch of imposter heroes waiting for us to tackle."
Dialog_Action_980500215_132,Justice will surely be served!
Dialog_Action_980500215_133,My axe has been thirsty. Let me cut a few imposters down to size!
Dialog_Action_980500215_134,"(The voice of Dr. Brainwash suddenly on the radio) Wait a minute, wait a minute, where do you hot-blooded lads think you are going? For a hang-out?"
Dialog_Action_980500215_135,"Here, let me, the real brain, show you a clear path!"
Dialog_Action_980500215_136,"Didn't think a mean AI like you was brought to the Wasteland as well. Needless to say, that was certainly Kent's idea."
Dialog_Action_980500215_137,"Yes, yes, I downloaded it to my personal terminal. He is of help, more or less!"
Dialog_Action_980500215_138,"""He is of help, more or less""? ? Look who's talking! I used to be ""Dr. Brainwash""! My thinking ability is stronger than you muggles combined!"
Dialog_Action_980500215_139,Enough with that. Take a look at this coordinate message I sent. This is the result I've got from analyzing Peter's previous record of every access to the Hubris Adventure: This place must be Peter Sharna's real hideout!
Dialog_Action_980500215_140,"Great, with these coordinates, we can finally shift from defense to attack!"
Dialog_Action_980500215_141,"Didn't think you could offer us such a big help, thank you, ""Dr. Brainwash""."
Dialog_Action_980500215_142,"Why waste time on this kind of meaningless courtesy? Get ready for the fight, it's time to end this!"
Dialog_Action_980500216_101,"(Radio) Ah, you finally got here."
Dialog_Action_980500216_102,"That's right, upon thinking that I can finally see you in the flesh, I feel a little excited."
Dialog_Action_980500216_103,"You have put us through so much trouble, we've got to return the favor, right? ... Don't you run!"
Dialog_Action_980500216_104,"(Radio) A mean talker as always. Honestly, I can go away at any moment if I want, but now that my plan is complete, there's no need to hide anymore."
Dialog_Action_980500216_105,"(Radio) Even if you guys kill me, it won't change anything. But I guess that's what you guys deserve... Come on, let's end this."
Dialog_Action_980500216_106,"(Radio) Friends, Peter's not bluffing, Diamond City Radio has received messages from dwellers everywhere about being attacked by ""super heroes"". But I have one more way..."
Dialog_Action_980500216_107,You attack Peter's base first and try to attract his attention. I'm going to do some preparation...
Dialog_Action_980500216_108,Don't keep us waiting for too long!
Dialog_Action_980500216_109,"Now, let's bring down some imposter heroes!"
Dialog_Action_980500216_110,"Aha, friends, you're late! The perfect team of Mistress of Mystery and Silver Shroud has swept all the evil away already!"
Dialog_Action_980500216_111,"It's just like how we eliminated those minions of Mechanist, right... Although they're made-up memories, but thanks to those memories, dealing with these imposters is effortless!"
Dialog_Action_980500216_112,How does it feel that you guys have fully adapted to the third generation of synths?
Dialog_Action_980500216_113,"It feels... very subtle. There's a lot in common with the virtual world of ""Hubris Adventure"", but I've never clearly felt my breath, my heart beats..."
Dialog_Action_980500216_114,"I can even feel every inch of my skin, and it's really a whole new experience."
Dialog_Action_980500216_115,"Well, thank the Institute for making the third generation of synths so perfect."
Dialog_Action_980500216_116,"Then let's see what this body can do! Heroes, move on, let us take care of your rear!"
Dialog_Action_980500216_117,Bring me more! ! These scrap metal are lousy opponents!
Dialog_Action_980500216_118,"Calm down, Grognak, you almost demolished this house."
Dialog_Action_980500216_119,"I've never felt so good! The world is so much fun, even though it's been ruined once, but still so full of glamour!"
Dialog_Action_980500216_120,"There are many surprises in this world, Grognak."
Dialog_Action_980500216_121,"According to Lady Irma, there are huge lizards in your world, ferocious giant bears..."
Dialog_Action_980500216_122,"And giant crabs, giant lobsters... it seems I can make quite many new friends!"
Dialog_Action_980500216_123,Uh... I wouldn't be so optimistic... actually...
Dialog_Action_980500216_124,"Wait, I seem to hear the voice of imposter heroes over there! Action! A glorious battle awaits us!"
Dialog_Action_980500216_125,What about Grognak? !Hold on......
Dialog_Action_980500216_126,"Someone has to go and see to that reckless barbarian. See you later, heroes!"
Dialog_Action_980500216_127,"I have cut off Peter's contact with the outside world, and there's no way he can get his minions as reinforcement."
Dialog_Action_980500216_128,"Thank you so much, The Inspector!"
Dialog_Action_980500216_129,"You are welcome. It's""Dr. Brainwash"". He's been of tremendous help."
Dialog_Action_980500216_130,"Speaking of which, our ""Dr. Brainwash"" has been surprisingly quiet. I thought he would detract from us with a few more words."
Dialog_Action_980500216_131,"I don't, because you are about to come across the final yet the most dangerous trouble. And that trouble -- is ""me."""
Dialog_Action_980500216_132,"""You""?"
Dialog_Action_980500216_133,"The last copy of data Peter extracted from the program that monitored me, was my own data."
Dialog_Action_980500216_134,"I presume it was a second-hand preparation just in case those of his imposter heroes should lose control, but today he would certainly use it to protect himself."
Dialog_Action_980500216_135,"That's his ace card, how ironic. At the end of the day, he needs a super villain to protect himself."
Dialog_Action_980500216_136,"Be assured, leave it to us."
Dialog_Action_980500216_137,"As an AI, all I can do is tell you this information."
Dialog_Action_980500216_138,"The world I live in is either black or white, and I am destined to be a villain from the moment I was created."
Dialog_Action_980500216_139,"But your world... is a complex world, and everything is so incomprehensible... even Peter's motives seem plausible to me."
Dialog_Action_980500216_140,"I just hope, this time — even if just once, I can stand on the right side."
Dialog_Action_980500216_141,"Exactly in this world what's right and what's wrong, I guess no one can solve that puzzle. I think all that we can do is believe in our inner choice!"
Dialog_Action_980500216_142,"Hah! ""The inner choice"", that is not funny. I also wish there would be something called ""heart""."
Dialog_Action_980500216_143,"Here we are, my friends from the Vault, and I've been looking forward to this day."
Dialog_Action_980500216_144,What a standard speech by a villain.
Dialog_Action_980500216_145,"So next, are you going to do a long speech and tell us your vision serves the justice?"
Dialog_Action_980500216_146,"What is justice and what is evil, does that really matter? If I have learned anything from the doom, it is that in reality, there doesn't exist what's right and wrong at all, and that there is only what you believe."
Dialog_Action_980500216_147,"But that's where you guys make me construed. Look, every character in this story has what he believes."
Dialog_Action_980500216_148,"I believe people should no longer indulge in illusory heroes; Kent believes he can return the super heroes to the Wasteland, and even the bandits I hired believe they can make a fortune, for a better life..."
Dialog_Action_980500216_149,"But you guys, you don't belong to any side. I said very early that I don't want to be your enemies, and you are free to leave at any time. But why are you so obsessed with being my enemy? What the hell is it that's propped you up till now?"
Dialog_Action_980500216_150,Well... You might not like the answer you will get.
Dialog_Action_980500216_151,"For us, we just want to enjoy the Hubris Comics."
Dialog_Action_980500216_152,"Look, even if it's something you want to erase right now, a lot of people still like it. Maybe deep inside you, you are not really hating these comics you've created."
Dialog_Action_980500216_153,I get it...
Dialog_Action_980500216_154,"It seems that I can't persuade you to leave, and the fight between us is inevitable. Although that can't change the outcome, maybe at the end of this, I'll be able to meet your desire to fight the super villain once."
Dialog_Action_980500216_155,"So, that's the ending."
Dialog_Action_980500216_156,"Torture me or kill me, you can't change the outcome all the same."
Dialog_Action_980500216_157,"We don't want to ""kill you"". Like you said, killing you can't change the outcome."
Dialog_Action_980500216_158,But our friends probably can.
Dialog_Action_980500216_159,Wh-What does that mean?
Dialog_Action_980500216_160,Huff... Huff... Finally caught up. Sorry to keep you waiting...
Dialog_Action_980500216_161,Kent! What are you doing here?
Dialog_Action_980500216_162,I... Huff... why don't you listen to it yourself... Huff... I gotta catch my breath... (Kent turns on the carry-on radio)
Dialog_Action_980500216_163,"Welcome back to ""Silver Shroud Radio""! Did you guys hear about it? There are plenty of robots coming out of the Commonwealth Wasteland. They are wearing super hero uniforms and creating chaos everywhere as miscreants! Whose conspiracy is all this exactly? And who can save the Commonwealth Wasteland?"
Dialog_Action_980500216_164,"Our hero, Silver Shroud, upon his investigations, has found out the guy behind the scenes: Dr. Brainwash! !"
Dialog_Action_980500216_165,"Exactly! That evil Dr. Brainwash has come to the Commonwealth Wasteland. As the sworn enemy of the Unstoppable Alliance, and that vile Dr. Brainwash came up with this trick to denigrate and defame our heroes."
Dialog_Action_980500216_166,Hah! How many people do you think would believe your gibberish? People only believe what they can see for themselves.
Dialog_Action_980500216_167,"... But don't fear or worry, because the real heroes have all come to the Commonwealth Wasteland! Silver Shroud has gathered all the members of the Unstoppable Alliance, and they would do away with these imposters and thwart the conspiracy of Dr. Brainwash!"
Dialog_Action_980500216_168,What? !
Dialog_Action_980500216_169,Coincidentally! I've just received messages from all over the Wasteland!
Dialog_Action_980500216_170,"It's true! I saw the Grognak the Barbarian at Hardware Town, roar and rip a couple of imposters who make trouble everywhere! It's true as hell! Just like in the comics!"
Dialog_Action_980500216_171,"I was forced onto the roof by a couple of fake heroes and when I was at the end of my rope, the Mistress of Mystery showed up! She shot down all the robots, and... and she smiled at me!"
Dialog_Action_980500216_172,"Just now a guy dressed like a fish saved me! He said he's Manta Man! Wait a minute, is there really such a hero?"
Dialog_Action_980500216_173,How... how is this possible?
Dialog_Action_980500216_174,"Peter, even though you kidnapped me, cajoled the dwellers of the Vault in my name, and even wanted to destroy my favorite comics, I never have truly felt despaired. I think it's time for you to meet these heroes."
Dialog_Action_980500216_175,You... the Unstoppable Alliance...
Dialog_Action_980500216_176,"Yes, we are AIs of the ""Hubris Adventure"", and technically you are our creator."
Dialog_Action_980500216_177,"Thanks to the friends of the Vault walking through the story of ""Hubris Adventure"", Kent implanted us into the body of synths so we could stand in this world and talk to you like this."
Dialog_Action_980500216_178,"Remarkable move, Kent, you win."
Dialog_Action_980500216_179,"You bring these ""heroes"" to me to humiliate me?"
Dialog_Action_980500216_180,"No, not really. I just want them to see you... they are fictional characters, but you also saw what they could do. They can inspire us so that we don't fall into despair."
Dialog_Action_980500216_181,"In a way, these fictional heroes are more ""real"" than us."
Dialog_Action_980500216_182,......
Dialog_Action_980500216_183,"You took advantage of us to do quite many horrible things, and I should have been outraged at you and imposed upon you sanctions of justice... but unexpectedly, meeting you doesn't make me feel angry, but pathetic."
Dialog_Action_980500216_184,"I guess you lost courage due to the disasters of the world, but only when one remains brave before his own fears can he carry on..."
Dialog_Action_980500216_185,"We all haven't given up on you, how can you give yourself up?"
Dialog_Action_980500216_186,"Peter, as the ghouls, we still have a long way to go. Maybe you won't agree with us, but that doesn't follow you are going to be in despair forever."
Dialog_Action_980500216_187,"This Hubris Incident is not the end of your life, and I think deep inside you, you still love these heroes you created. The question is: what do you really want to do next?"
Dialog_Action_980500216_188,......
Dialog_Action_980500216_189,I think... I think maybe... I could create some new stories about the Unstoppable Alliance on the Wasteland...
Dialog_Action_980500227_101,Where am I... Um... it seems there's only us left here.
Dialog_Action_980500227_102,"It seems we're going to have to face your fears here, Mistress of Mystery."
Dialog_Action_980500227_103,"I'm curious, for someone as strong and calm as you, what would have you scared?"
Dialog_Action_980500227_104,"The source of fear lies in the unknown, and it's possible that we'll encounter something that I don't know at all."
Dialog_Action_980500227_105,"And, honestly, I think it might just be a defense mechanism that I don't understand. After all, you know -- I'm just an AI."
Dialog_Action_980500227_106,If only things were as easy as what you said.
Dialog_Action_980500227_107,"It's weird though, I feel... familiar here..."
Dialog_Action_980500227_108,That person is...
Dialog_Action_980500227_109,Th-That's me? Is this some kind of illusion?
Dialog_Action_980500227_110,"Your plaguing the world is at its end, robbers!"
Dialog_Action_980500227_111,"What kind of gibberish are you talking about, old woman! Trying to be a hero? Wake up to the reality, the world has been destroyed, and it is now the world where the powerful survive!"
Dialog_Action_980500227_112,"Even if the world has been destroyed, it does not mean that you can be a miscreant bullying on the Wasteland. If there is no one else to stop you, it will be me and the Mystery Order to stop you!"
Dialog_Action_980500227_113,Hah! Hah! Hahaha! It seems we have a blundering idiot here! What's with the Mystery Order? You think you are the Mistress of Mystery after reading all those comics?
Dialog_Action_980500227_114,"Boss, wait, she looks familiar, and she's like... like Shannon Rivers, the voice actress for the Mistress of Mystery!"
Dialog_Action_980500227_115,"No, to you villains I am Mistress of Mystery!"
Dialog_Action_980500227_116,"Henceforth, the Mystery Order will grow and protect the people of Appalachian Wasteland."
Dialog_Action_980500227_117,That... that's... the real Mistress of Mystery...
Dialog_Action_980500227_118,"I seem to have heard the story of Shannon Rivers, no wonder it feels familiar here."
Dialog_Action_980500227_119,Looks like we have to move on in order to know the end of the story. Let's go ahead.
Dialog_Action_980500227_120,"Olivia, what have you done?"
Dialog_Action_980500227_121,"Why, honey, why would you do that?"
Dialog_Action_980500227_122,I'm going to get this right with her. I... maybe I'm the only one left in the Mystery Order...
Dialog_Action_980500227_123,"It's all over, the Mystery Order is finished! If anyone still lives to see this message, get out of here and stay alive! That's the only thing that matters, to stay alive!"
Dialog_Action_980500227_124,"I love you guys... Sorry, really sorry..."
Dialog_Action_980500227_125,What exactly happened... What happened to the Mystery Order?
Dialog_Action_980500227_126,"I also heard the story of Shannon from told by many drunk men. It seems that the end of this story is not perfect, Mistress of Mystery, will you keep going?"
Dialog_Action_980500227_127,"(Mistress of Mystery's voice is low but firm) Whatever the ending is, I must know it!"
Dialog_Action_980500227_128,"Intruders! You guys are here to meet your death... Wait a minute, the Mystery Order? Are you not all dead?"
Dialog_Action_980500227_129,I'm not with the Mystery Order. But what exactly happened to the Mystery Order?
Dialog_Action_980500227_130,You're not with the Mystery Order? So what are you doing here in their ridiculous costume?
Dialog_Action_980500227_131,Don't you know that the bunch of chicks from the Mystery Order have all been dead?
Dialog_Action_980500227_132,"Hahahahaha! Speaking of which, so stupid were those women that they killed each other before we made our move!"
Dialog_Action_980500227_133,Not to mention that the traitor is the biological daughter of their chief. It's so ironic!
Dialog_Action_980500227_134,No! That can't be real!
Dialog_Action_980500227_135,"Real as hell, one of our peers saw with his eyes the dueling between the last two members of the Mystery Order, hahahaha!"
Dialog_Action_980500227_136,"Wake up, that's the real world, that ridiculous role-playing leads to death only!"
Dialog_Action_980500227_137,No! No!
Dialog_Action_980500227_138,"You finally saw that, the truth of this world."
Dialog_Action_980500227_139,Mistress of Mystery... It's just a joke.
Dialog_Action_980500227_140,Even my biological daughter opposed my ideals and sold our secrets to the robbers.
Dialog_Action_980500227_141,The kids I raised as my own... died one after another...
Dialog_Action_980500227_142,"In the end, instead of losing to the robbers, we lost to ourselves."
Dialog_Action_980500227_143,"That, is the real Wasteland. There is no hope, no ideals, no one can get salvation."
Dialog_Action_980500227_144,I... I'm not accepting this!
Dialog_Action_980500227_145,"You have to, because that's the reality."
Dialog_Action_980500228_101,"Why are you guys still here? The Mystery Order is finished, it was my naivety that killed us all!"
Dialog_Action_980500228_102,......
Dialog_Action_980500228_103,"""Mistress of Mystery"" was just a fantasy of the previous world. In this uncompromising Wasteland, its existence is meaningless."
Dialog_Action_980500228_104,You're right...
Dialog_Action_980500228_105,"Cheer up a little, Mistress of Mystery!"
Dialog_Action_980500228_106,I'm not the Mistress of Mystery... I'm just... a false idol... that was created to entertain the masses...
Dialog_Action_980500228_107,"Even the real Mistress of Mystery failed, I'm... just an... an AI..."
Dialog_Action_980500228_108,So what?
Dialog_Action_980500228_109,"""So what? ""... I don't understand what you mean."
Dialog_Action_980500228_110,"Even if you are an AI, so what? What you represent is people's vision of the Mistress of Mystery, which makes you the Mistress of Mystery."
Dialog_Action_980500228_111,"Shannon's failure was because she was a mortal after all. Everyone makes mistakes, and we're no exception. But you, you can learn from Shannon's defeat and avoid going down the same path."
Dialog_Action_980500228_112,I...
Dialog_Action_980500228_113,"Failure is not terrible. But she will be reborn from the ashes of the Mystery Order as a symbol, and that's what the Mistress of Mystery means to people."
Dialog_Action_980500228_114,...
Dialog_Action_980500228_115,"You're right, even though I'm just an AI, I'm going to inherit Mistress of Mystery's ideals."
Dialog_Action_980500228_116,No! No! Don't repeat my stupid fantasy again!
Dialog_Action_980500228_117,"I will not hesitate or be afraid again. The will of the Mistress of Mystery will never falter, never has and never will!"
Dialog_Action_980500228_118,No!
Dialog_Action_980500228_119,Do you really want to go down that path?
Dialog_Action_980500228_120,You could have stayed in this world and ignored that despairing Wasteland.
Dialog_Action_980500228_121,"I've made the decision. Even though the truth is so heavy, I will embrace it."
Dialog_Action_980500228_122,......
Dialog_Action_980500228_123,"What does ""Mistress of Mystery"" represent?"
Dialog_Action_980500228_124,"Courage, wit, mercy."
Dialog_Action_980500228_125,"For the rest of my life, I've been just an actress. Playing a hero in radio and a hero on the Wasteland. Although I have failed, the Wasteland still needs heroes, and someone needs to come forward to protect the weak and protect each other."
Dialog_Action_980500228_126,"And I, am but an actress. Maybe I will fail too, maybe I'll die. But I won't be daunted. The Mistress of Mystery will live on in the people's memories."
Dialog_Action_980500228_127,That's fine... That's fine...
Dialog_Action_980500217_101,"Friends, are you here to help me overcome my fears? Although I don't know what we're going to face, justice will not refuse the assistance of friends!"
Dialog_Action_980500217_102,"Speaking of which, I'm curious what Silver Shroud fears."
Dialog_Action_980500217_103,"What even scares the dauntless Silver Shroud, it may be allergies, or big spiders, you know, as big as a basin."
Dialog_Action_980500217_104,"I heard that your world has cockroaches about a basic large and two-story lizards. If I would fear a spider, how would I serve as a hero for justice?"
Dialog_Action_980500217_105,That's right.
Dialog_Action_980500217_106,"Then let's get going! See what ""my fear"" is!"
Dialog_Action_980500217_107,Ssh. Something's over there!
Dialog_Action_980500217_108,"Hell, how come the goods haven't arrived yet?"
Dialog_Action_980500217_109,Be patient. Keep waiting.
Dialog_Action_980500217_110,"How can I be patient? ! Boss said, this shipment is important, and it will save one more person if delivered a second earlier!"
Dialog_Action_980500217_111,"You're right, but we'll keep waiting!"
Dialog_Action_980500217_112,"No, I can't wait. I'm going to check out what happened!"
Dialog_Action_980500217_113,Hold on...
Dialog_Action_980500217_114,Just a bunch of hooligans. I don't know how many such perpetrators have been dealt with. Why fear at all?
Dialog_Action_980500217_115,"Come on, friends, follow their trail and find their ringleader."
Dialog_Action_980500217_116,"I think something's off, and these gangsters look a little different."
Dialog_Action_980500217_117,Better be more careful. Remember how many times the Mistress of Mystery has told you not to act rashly?
Dialog_Action_980500217_118,... Makes sense.
Dialog_Action_980500217_119,Why ruin the agreement?
Dialog_Action_980500217_120,Didn't we agree to everything? !
Dialog_Action_980500217_121,"Sorry, for this shipment, now we're going to double the price!"
Dialog_Action_980500217_122,You!
Dialog_Action_980500217_123,"This is the case in this world of the law of jungle. After all, your boss wants this shipment so desperately."
Dialog_Action_980500217_124,Hell! It's you or me!
Dialog_Action_980500217_125,Impressive. You dare to make waves on our turf. Finish them!
Dialog_Action_980500217_126,It's the first time I've seen something like this... these gangs seem not to be that simple...
Dialog_Action_980500217_127,So what should we do now?
Dialog_Action_980500217_128,Track them down! Find their boss and we should reach the bottom of everything.
Dialog_Action_980500217_129,What does that mean? What about my men? How did you guys break in?
Dialog_Action_980500217_130,"Your tyranny has come to an end! Scoundrel! ...Wait a minute, how come you look familiar to me?"
Dialog_Action_980500217_131,Kent? How is that possible? Aren't you the biggest fan of Silver Shroud? How could you become a... criminal then?
Dialog_Action_980500217_132,What do you say?
Dialog_Action_980500217_133,Silver Shroud? It's a name I haven't heard in a long time.
Dialog_Action_980500217_134,"You can't forget Silver Shroud, you've been running Silver Shroud Radio for so many years since the disaster!"
Dialog_Action_980500217_135,"Ah, speaking of radio... I used to be so obsessed with Silver Shroud, but guess what. No one responded to me."
Dialog_Action_980500217_136,"In this world, heroes have long been forgotten!"
Dialog_Action_980500217_137,"No, no way! Even though it is true, you shouldn't become such a criminal against justice!"
Dialog_Action_980500217_138,"""Justice""? Wake up, the world is never either black or white."
Dialog_Action_980500217_139,"After I completely abandoned Silver Shroud Radio, I started empty-handed and built this underground kingdom."
Dialog_Action_980500217_140,For it is only possible to gain a foothold in this sinful world when one has enough strength. Evils must be met by evils so my friends and families can be protected.
Dialog_Action_980500217_141,Then... the gangsters we just saw...
Dialog_Action_980500217_142,Those are my little helpers. The swag they bought has the drugs the poor people on my turf need to stay alive... Did anything happen to them?
Dialog_Action_980500217_143,My... my God...
Dialog_Action_980500217_144,"I see. Looks like they can't make it back... You guys will not get out of here alive! Guards, take them down!"
Dialog_Action_980500217_145,What exactly is right and what is wrong...
Dialog_Action_980500217_146,Silver Shroud? Silver Shroud?
Dialog_Action_980500217_147,What exactly is justice? Do those criminals I've got rid of deserve the punishment?
Dialog_Action_980500217_148,Sober up! Silver Shroud!
Dialog_Action_980500217_149,(The eyes of Silver Shroud have never been disengaged like that)
Dialog_Action_980500217_150,Silver Shroud!
Dialog_Action_980500218_101,"So you guys still caught up. Humph, you sure are Silver Shroud."
Dialog_Action_980500218_102,I... I don't know what I'm supposed to do...
Dialog_Action_980500218_103,"Silver Shroud, cheer up! Don't forget what you're here for!"
Dialog_Action_980500218_104,"In all my memories, all I know is justice and evil, they are as distinguishable as day and night. But, the real world... it's not at all what I thought it was."
Dialog_Action_980500218_105,"If I simply don't know what justice is, how do I carry through my own justice?"
Dialog_Action_980500218_106,"Oh, come on. Justice isn't something that complicated at all!"
Dialog_Action_980500218_107,What?
Dialog_Action_980500218_108,"Indeed, the real world is like the mist that enshrouds death, and veils what is right and wrong. Maybe when you are picking a wrong side, the other side is wrong, too."
Dialog_Action_980500218_109,"But with that, you're not going forward? I am sure that's not Silver Shroud I know."
Dialog_Action_980500218_110,To serve the justice in your heart is to stay true to yourself and bear the consequences of your choice.
Dialog_Action_980500218_111,"Even if your choice may bring tragedy and misery, it is your justice if you don't fail your heart. You will never lose your justice even on the Wasteland where human nature is a mystery."
Dialog_Action_980500218_112,Justice...
Dialog_Action_980500218_113,"Think about it, what are you going to do now?"
Dialog_Action_980500218_114,I... I'm going to overcome my bewilderment and fear!
Dialog_Action_980500218_115,"Oh! It seems you've made up your mind, then you should know what to do."
Dialog_Action_980500218_116,"Yes! Death has come for you -- the bewitching phantom, and I am its Shroud!"
Dialog_Action_980500218_117,"Silver Shroud, you're finally back."
Dialog_Action_980500218_118,"Yes, you can't bewilder me anymore."
Dialog_Action_980500218_119,"Even though the real world is not either black and white, I believe that my every choice complies with my conscience."
Dialog_Action_980500218_120,"Ah, that's my Silver Shroud, the incarnation of justice. I hope that in your future road, there will not be a moment of bewilderment..."
Dialog_Action_980500218_121,Don't worry. Justice prevails!
Dialog_Action_980500247_101,Aha! My friends! Let's start a new legendary adventure!
Dialog_Action_980500247_102,Why are you so worked up? Aren't we going to face your fear?
Dialog_Action_980500247_103,"Are you kidding me? What fear would I have! If I actually had fear, I'd use my axe to fix it too!"
Dialog_Action_980500247_104,Can anything be fixed with an axe?
Dialog_Action_980500247_105,"That is, of course. If one axe can't solve anything, make it two!"
Dialog_Action_980500247_106,"What's that? I seem to hear the sound of fighting, friends, meet you on the battlefield!"
Dialog_Action_980500247_107,The Inspector! What's this about?
Dialog_Action_980500247_108,Which vile guy killed my friend? !
Dialog_Action_980500247_109,"I think we're in great trouble, the man who can bring down the The Inspector, must be a bad ass."
Dialog_Action_980500247_110,"Grognak, do you have any idea?"
Dialog_Action_980500247_111,"How would I have? But when I find out who he is, I must smash him to pieces!"
Dialog_Action_980500247_112,That can't be real! Manta Man! The Inspector! Which vile villian killed my friend?!
Dialog_Action_980500247_113,Looks like the fatal injury is caused by an axe or a sword...
Dialog_Action_980500247_114,What do you say?
Dialog_Action_980500247_115,I checked and it was indeed a fatal injury caused by a giant axe.
Dialog_Action_980500247_116,"No... No, no, no... How is that possible? !"
Dialog_Action_980500247_117,What's wrong?
Dialog_Action_980500247_118,"I... In my earliest adventure -- I mean in my memory of being manipulated, I met a wizard."
Dialog_Action_980500247_119,He predicted that one day I would be swallowed by my own lust for battle and turn into the incarnation of rage: Grognarok.
Dialog_Action_980500247_120,Meaning the executioner of fate.
Dialog_Action_980500247_121,"He also said no one could stop Grognarok, including his friends."
Dialog_Action_980500247_122,"All along, I've thought it was just the nonsense of that wizard... could that damn prophecy be true?"
Dialog_Action_980500247_123,"Don't be too nervous, Grognak, it's probably just some vicious vision."
Dialog_Action_980500247_124,The murderer is nearby! Let's catch him up and sort it out!
Dialog_Action_980500247_125,"Sober up, Grognak! Don't be swallowed by anger!"
Dialog_Action_980500247_126,"(Grognarok's face is twisted because of anger, and he speechlessly raises the Eternal Axe)"
Dialog_Action_980500247_127,No!
Dialog_Action_980500247_128,Fight! Fight! More battles and glory!
Dialog_Action_980500247_129,Sorry... my friend...
Dialog_Action_980500247_130,G-Grognak... You... Destroyed us... All...
Dialog_Action_980500247_131,"... That guy, he's not me..."
Dialog_Action_980500247_132,No... he... is you...
Dialog_Action_980500247_133,Grognarok... we gotta catch up with that guy! I'm going to avenge my friends!
Dialog_Action_980500247_134,But how do you fight yourself?
Dialog_Action_980500247_135,I don't know... This time... I really don't know...
Dialog_Action_980500248_101,I will not allow you to hurt anyone again!
Dialog_Action_980500248_102,Stop me? I am you!
Dialog_Action_980500248_103,"You've been swallowed up by anger and desire for battle, and I'm not going to become someone like you!"
Dialog_Action_980500248_104,"More battles and more glory, isn't that exactly what you've been craving?"
Dialog_Action_980500248_105,I...
Dialog_Action_980500248_106,"You can't possibly stop me, your humanity makes you weak. And I'm the perfect you!"
Dialog_Action_980500248_107,Accept the reality! Only by being a fighter like me can you overcome your enemies!
Dialog_Action_980500248_108,No... no! !
Dialog_Action_980500248_109,"Grognak, accept the reality!"
Dialog_Action_980500248_110,Wh--what? Which side are you on?
Dialog_Action_980500248_111,You were born with the desire to fight. Denial of that is denial of yourself.
Dialog_Action_980500248_112,But the prophecy... the desire to fight will devour me...
Dialog_Action_980500248_113,"Instead of fearing your anger and desire, you should embrace it, control it and let it be a part of you."
Dialog_Action_980500248_114,"And, your human nature doesn't make you weak, it's the very thing that really makes you stronger. Embrace your anger, but keep your human nature so you can become a true hero!"
Dialog_Action_980500248_115,"Have you guys had enough? I'm still in a hurry. After I take down you soft eggs, I've got more honorable battles awaiting me!"
Dialog_Action_980500248_116,"... They're right, and I shouldn't fear my own desire."
Dialog_Action_980500248_117,"You are a part of me, an incarnation of rage after I threw away human nature. And it's the human nature that makes me stronger. You can't hurt me."
Dialog_Action_980500248_118,"Fool, would you like to give it a try?"
Dialog_Action_980500248_119,Bring it on!
Dialog_Action_980500248_120,That's the first time I've heard a request like that! Then I wouldn't wait!
Dialog_Action_980500248_121,"Hah! That idiot. Self do, self have!"
Dialog_Action_980500248_122,No one can stop me! Not even myself! I... uh... how come I'm not feeling comfortable...
Dialog_Action_980500248_123,Now!
Dialog_Action_980500248_124,"Nice job, my friends, I'm feeling better now."
Dialog_Action_980500248_125,Having Grognarok knock himself down... how did you come up with that idea?
Dialog_Action_980500248_126,"After I accepted that he was me, I immediately remembered Mistress of Mystery's words: I was just an AI playing Grognak."
Dialog_Action_980500248_127,"When I accept that, I believe Grognarok must also be a simulation program built on my own. However powerful it is, it can't possibly devour its true self, can it?"
Dialog_Action_980500248_128,"So, it's nothing to fear at all."
Dialog_Action_980500248_129,"I never thought I would hear such rigorous logic from the mouth of a barbarian! Grognak, you really have my eyes polished!"
Dialog_Action_980500248_130,"Right, are you not bothered by the fact that you're an AI?"
Dialog_Action_980500248_131,"What is there to be bothered by? Even though I'm not Grognak for real, so what? I've got fine wines, friends, epic adventures and battles, what else do I crave for?"
Dialog_Action_980500237_101,Look around. We should be back at the bottom of the sea.
Dialog_Action_980500237_102,"So, is it Manta Man's turn to face his fears?"
Dialog_Action_980500237_103,But where is he? Can't see him around at all.
Dialog_Action_980500237_104,"Maybe we should search everywhere. With his simple mind, he might be looking for his fish and shrimp friends for a small chat."
Dialog_Action_980500237_105,I seem to have heard Manta Man's voice.
Dialog_Action_980500237_106,Really?
Dialog_Action_980500237_107,It seems like it's nearby... Maybe right behind the locked gate here!
Dialog_Action_980500237_108,(Manta Man's laughter from afar)
Dialog_Action_980500237_109,He seems to be laughing happily.
Dialog_Action_980500237_110,"Could he be charmed by mermaids, could he not?"
Dialog_Action_980500237_111,Damn it... He is close at hand.
Dialog_Action_980500237_112,"Don't worry, there must be some clues nearby. Hell, this guy really makes people worry."
Dialog_Action_980500237_113,"Ah, friends, you came just in time! My brother and I are preparing for a grand celebration!"
Dialog_Action_980500237_114,Your arrival is truly a grace! You are welcome to join our celebration!
Dialog_Action_980500237_115,Celebration? For what?
Dialog_Action_980500237_116,Of course it's for the reunion with my brother! Dr. Brainwash has been defeated and we have ushered in the peace!
Dialog_Action_980500237_117,(Whisper) Isn't he a little bit confused?
Dialog_Action_980500237_118,Manta Man! Did you forget? We didn't beat Dr. Brainwash; you came here to conquer your own fears!
Dialog_Action_980500237_119,Hah! Hah! Hah! What are you talking about? You look around. This is my home and we don't need to fight anymore!
Dialog_Action_980500237_120,"Sober up, it's not your home, it's the Nuniverse, and it's an exceptionally dangerous Time Rift!"
Dialog_Action_980500237_121,Wh-What are you talking about?
Dialog_Action_980500237_122,"My brother invited you to join us in this celebration, and you treat my brother with that attitude?"
Dialog_Action_980500237_123,It seems someone has to teach you a lesson of proper manners? Guards! The lesson must be taught to these outsiders!
Dialog_Action_980500237_124,"Let's go, brother, there's a lot to be prepared for the celebration."
Dialog_Action_980500237_125,Uh... right...
Dialog_Action_980500237_126,Manta Man must have been mystified by the visions here.
Dialog_Action_980500237_127,"But it's strange, the The Inspector made it clear that the heroes are supposed to overcome their fears. So what on earth does Manta Man fear? He looks very happy."
Dialog_Action_980500237_128,"It really is a question. And if we can't find out what his fears really are, there's no way to help him overcome his own fears."
Dialog_Action_980500238_101,Why are you still here? I remember saying you are not welcome here.
Dialog_Action_980500238_102,"Wait a minute, my brother, it looks like they have something to say."
Dialog_Action_980500238_103,"Manta Man, think about why you came here!"
Dialog_Action_980500238_104,"Wake up, Manta Man, you're entranced by these visions."
Dialog_Action_980500238_105,"I... I seem to have remembered. I seem to be in an adventure, into a Time Rift..."
Dialog_Action_980500238_106,"Brother, are you confused? You're home! We are preparing a celebration for you."
Dialog_Action_980500238_107,Home... um... it feels so good to be home...
Dialog_Action_980500238_108,That's right! Manta Man is a very sensitive man who is afraid of losing his friends and family!
Dialog_Action_980500238_109,"Manta Man, think hard, this is not your home!"
Dialog_Action_980500238_110,Shut up!
Dialog_Action_980500238_111,Evil visions have taken advantage of your fear of losing your families and friends and made this place look like a home. But you should know that none of this is true!
Dialog_Action_980500238_112,"My brother, is this all true?"
Dialog_Action_980500238_113,......
Dialog_Action_980500238_114,"Manta Man, it seems you've finally figured it out. But do you really think you can give it all up?"
Dialog_Action_980500238_115,You... you're not my brother! This is not my home!
Dialog_Action_980500238_116,"Quite the opposite, this world is your home! You can play a super hero in this world forever, without losing your families, or friends."
Dialog_Action_980500238_117,What can you get without losing? Real families and friends are those who you can stand along with and share the losses and pains.
Dialog_Action_980500238_118,"Your real family and friends are waiting for you at the other end of the Time Rift, Manta Man!"
Dialog_Action_980500238_119,I get it.
Dialog_Action_980500238_120,A man can never grow up if he can not accept that he would lose something important.
Dialog_Action_980500238_121,Can you really get your hands on your brother?
Dialog_Action_980500238_122,"Sometimes you gotta know when to let go, ""brother."""
Dialog_Action_980500238_123,"It's over, we should hit the road."
Dialog_Action_980500238_124,"Manta Man, glad you're back."
Dialog_Action_980500238_125,"Actually, I've thought about it, I don't have a home at all."
Dialog_Action_980500238_126,"I'm just an AI, playing the role of Manta Man. My ""home"" and my little brother, are all just made-up lies."
Dialog_Action_980500238_127,How sadistically true.
Dialog_Action_980500238_128,"No grief, Manta Man. Remember those friends who have gone through the same ordeal. The Unstoppable Alliance, they are your family."
Dialog_Action_980500238_129,"And joining your adventure, we are also your families."
Dialog_Action_980500238_130,You guys...
Dialog_Action_980500238_131,I... suddenly don't know what to say... But maybe this is the first time I've felt being home.
Dialog_Action_33010110_101,"Outsiders, I have bad news for you guys."
Dialog_Action_33010110_102,"The Oasis is not far away, but the problem is that we are going through the territory of the Slavers, and those guys are in control of the Montgomery Area, with powerful clout."
Dialog_Action_33010110_103,Slavers? I remember the name of your organization is called the Abolitionists. It there any relation?
Dialog_Action_33010110_104,"That's right, the Abolitionists are the enemy of the Slavers. The war between us has been going on for years. We are outnumbered but we fight with our wisdom."
Dialog_Action_33010110_105,"But you guys didn't actually win, did you?"
Dialog_Action_33010110_106,"It's a shame, we really haven't made a lot of substantial progress. Instead, this war has cost us a lot of great abolitionist warriors."
Dialog_Action_33010110_107,"Speaking of which, I have a request that may sound improper. Not long ago we had a conflict with Slavers near this reservoir, and several abolitionist warriors were missing."
Dialog_Action_33010110_108,"I would like to ask you to help investigate the battlefield and see if you can find clues about them. In the worst case, I'd like to retrieve their bodies."
Dialog_Action_33010110_109,"Although we don't want to get into trouble in this place, it sounds like there must be a war between us and the Slavers. Okay, we'll help you."
Dialog_Action_33010110_110,But we don't guarantee finding them.
Dialog_Action_33010110_111,"Boss, Boss, a message from the Headquarters orders us to return to the Paradise Falls right away."
Dialog_Action_33010110_112,What? Didn't we just come back here? How come the recent dispatch is so frequent? No force available at the Headquarters?
Dialog_Action_33010110_113,I don't know very much. But I heard that there would be a big move at the Headquarters recently!
Dialog_Action_33010110_114,Big move... When would we get to take part in a big move... Alright. What does the Headquarters want us there?
Dialog_Action_33010110_115,"To transport a group of new captives, the Abolitionists."
Dialog_Action_33010110_116,What? ! The captives we just shipped over yesterday! Arrrrgh! They are really playing us like monkeys.
Dialog_Action_33010110_117,"Boss, Boss! Keep it down! Someone might be eavesdropping!"
Dialog_Action_33010110_118,What's there to fear? It's a bad day. How worse can it be?
Dialog_Action_33010110_119,"Speaking of which, allow us to introduce ourselves."
Dialog_Action_33010110_120,We are Wishmasters that can fulfill the wish to make it a worse day!
Dialog_Action_33010110_121,"It seems that those brothers of mine are not dead, which is good news."
Dialog_Action_33010110_122,Do you want to save them? Is Paradise Falls a base camp for Slavers? Sounds like very dangerous.
Dialog_Action_33010110_123,"Indeed, the Slavers there are all too vicious and devious, but we have to take the risk."
Dialog_Action_33010110_124,"I'm interested in what they call ""big move"". Have these guys dug gold?"
Dialog_Action_33010110_125,Hmm...
Dialog_Action_33010110_126,I got an idea. Why don't we pose as slave buyers and sneak into Paradise Falls and see what hot stuff we can dig up.
Dialog_Action_33010310_101,"Remember, when you're dressed as slave buyers, be sure to focus on your roles. After all, they are professionals."
Dialog_Action_33010310_102,"I have a question, why do you think we can pass it off? I don't think I have a talent for acting."
Dialog_Action_33010310_103,"You are outsiders, and the slaves don't know your background, which means the chances of success are greater, right?"
Dialog_Action_33010310_104,"Well, I wouldn't hold much hope."
Dialog_Action_33010310_105,"Believe in yourself, things will eventually sort themselves out!"
Dialog_Action_33010310_106,Freeze! Who are you!?
Dialog_Action_33010310_107,"Uh... Hi, there! We are... businessmen from the Commonwealth Wasteland! Heard you guys have ""goods"" here?"
Dialog_Action_33010310_108,Goods? What are you talking about?
Dialog_Action_33010310_109,"You know, it's that kind of ""goods"" that... uh... will move."
Dialog_Action_33010310_110,"Ah, you mean the slaves. Ah, relax, man. We don't need to be cautious here."
Dialog_Action_33010310_111,"I didn't think you were guests from afar. Come on inside, please! When it comes to slaves, we have whatever you want and you will be satisfied."
Dialog_Action_33010310_112,(Whispers) What? It's that simple?
Dialog_Action_33010310_113,What do you say?
Dialog_Action_33010310_114,"I mean... uh, didn't expect you guys to be so hospitable!"
Dialog_Action_33010310_115,"Naturally, the Capital Wasteland has always been known for its hospitality. To wish us success in our business, come shake a hand first!"
Dialog_Action_33010310_116,Handshake?
Dialog_Action_33010310_117,"Yeah, don't you have a handshake custom here?"
Dialog_Action_33010310_118,What are you doing? !
Dialog_Action_33010310_119,I'm sorry... I couldn't hold it back...
Dialog_Action_33010310_120,End of sneak action...
Dialog_Action_33010310_121,Uh... Stop torturing us...
Dialog_Action_33010310_122,Are you the Abolitionists? Hannibal told us to save you.
Dialog_Action_33010310_123,Hannibal? You know our chief? Looks like that won't die in here.
Dialog_Action_33010310_124,But are you crazy? How dare you make a big shot at the base camp of these Slavers!
Dialog_Action_33010310_125,Hey! We were trying to sneak in!
Dialog_Action_33010310_126,"Strangely though, as a base camp of the Slavers, there are very few guards, and where have they gone?"
Dialog_Action_33010310_127,"With that, I seemed to hear a guard yesterday saying there would be a ""big deal"" ath the Alien Crash Site, and most of the Slavers probably have run there."
Dialog_Action_33010310_128,Big deal?
Dialog_Action_33010310_129,Alien Crash Site?
Dialog_Action_33010310_130,"Exactly, at least that's what I've heard."
Dialog_Action_33010310_131,"Alright, do these Slavers have a bigger conspiracy cooking in secret?"
Dialog_Action_33010310_132,Let's get back to that later. We'd better escort the Abolitionists out of here before the large force of the Slavers return!
Dialog_Action_33010510_101,"According to the Abolitionists who we rescued, this is the place where the Slavers say ""big deal"" will take place."
Dialog_Action_33010510_102,"Heard it's the ""Alien Crash Site""? How did I not see an alien spacecraft?"
Dialog_Action_33010510_103,"Hey, keep it down. Look over there, who are there?"
Dialog_Action_33010510_104,Hey! Why's there another wave of Slavers? Are you so ill-informed?
Dialog_Action_33010510_105,After all they are a bunch of primitive people. Can't be too demanding on them.
Dialog_Action_33010510_106,We don't...
Dialog_Action_33010510_107,(Whispers) It seems they've mistaken us as Slavers. Let's play along and see what we can get.
Dialog_Action_33010510_108,"Uh... We ran into the attacks of the Deathclaws on the road, hence the delay!"
Dialog_Action_33010510_109,Did you? It's so lucky you guys are alive.
Dialog_Action_33010510_110,"Look, the business here is finished. We have recovered the ""assets"" here, and the safe passage you provide is rather reliable."
Dialog_Action_33010510_111,Haha... Tell me about it... Haha...
Dialog_Action_33010510_112,"As a reward, we will be transmitting a batch of the Enclave's high-tech arms to you. But it's totally your stuff whether you can use them or not. Don't discharge and blow your heads off!"
Dialog_Action_33010510_113,"Sir, it's time to evacuate..."
Dialog_Action_33010510_114,"Um... that's right. Hey, the Slavers over there, go find your boss near the Oasis. We still need your help with our operations in the Oasis!"
Dialog_Action_33010510_115,"Oasis? You guys... I mean, what are we going to the Oasis for?"
Dialog_Action_33010510_116,"The tree, of course! Didn't your Boss tell you?"
Dialog_Action_33010510_117,Sir! This was what they had been informed about a week ago!
Dialog_Action_33010510_118,"What? !However ill-informed these primitive guys are, they should've received it a long time ago! You guys are not Slavers! Fire!"
Dialog_Action_33010510_119,"Ha, these Enclaves are really talkative!"
Dialog_Action_33010510_120,"The Abolitionists who were rescued by you told me about the business of Slavers here... It seems I've come late, what happened?"
Dialog_Action_33010510_121,"The Slavers and the Enclave made some sort of agreement where the Enclave gave the Slavers high-tech arms, and the Slavers gave the Enclave safe passage to recover some sort of ""assets""..."
Dialog_Action_33010510_122,"Too bad. Slavers and the Enclave would be allied... And these ""assets"", something must be off with them. And what?"
Dialog_Action_33010510_123,Their next target is the Oasis and that Talking Tree.
Dialog_Action_33010510_124,"What? ! That's too bad! If they rush to the Oasis ahead of us, the people over there are completely done for."
Dialog_Action_33010510_125,We must head out for the Oasis right away!
Dialog_Action_50002_101,"This is the Oasis, people. Thank goodness, it seems that the Enclave and the Slavers haven't plagued the place yet."
Dialog_Action_50002_102,That tree... Could it be...
Dialog_Action_50002_103,"Exactly, I've only met him once, but his intelligence has benefited me tremendously."
Dialog_Action_50002_104,"Harold, it's been a long time, are you alright!"
Dialog_Action_50002_105,Akh... Kah... Mhm... Hannibal?
Dialog_Action_50002_106,It... It talks!
Dialog_Action_50002_107,A little closer... Akh... I can't hear you talking from afar...
Dialog_Action_50002_108,"Harold, these outsiders want to know the intelligence about the Enclave. And... the Enclave seems to be interested in you, do you know the reason?"
Dialog_Action_50002_109,Akh! Akh-kah-akh-kah! The Enclave... Well... I think I know why they're interested in me.
Dialog_Action_50002_110,Do you know the Enclave's secret? Do tell us!
Dialog_Action_50002_111,"Don't hurry, sit down first, boy, I will tell you that..."
Dialog_Action_50002_112,"I actually wasn't what you are looking at, and I was just a regular Wasteland merchant long ago."
Dialog_Action_50002_113,"But in the midst of an adventure, I was severely infected with FEV. I've become a ghoul ever since. What mutated with me was the little sapling on my head."
Dialog_Action_50002_114,"Over time, this little sapling has grown bigger and merged with me, into what you are looking at right now."
Dialog_Action_50002_115,FEV? ! Did you just say FEV?
Dialog_Action_50002_116,"Yes, and one of those behind the FEV Virus is the Enclave. For so many years, they never have abandoned FEV research, nor did they ever give up on using FEV to destroy the peace on the Wasteland."
Dialog_Action_50002_117,"That's why the Enclave is interested in you so much! Shoot, now the Enclave and the Slavers have joined forces and will be here soon."
Dialog_Action_50002_118,"There's no way for people here to fight against the Enclave, let alone when it's bound with Slavers!"
Dialog_Action_50002_119,What should we do...
Dialog_Action_50002_120,"Hannibal, say, has the Enclave allied with the Slavers? The Enclave would never really believe in any Wastelander, and the Slavers were also a bunch of guys with no sense of glory, maybe... you could take advantage of that?"
Dialog_Action_50002_121,Damn... you're right! We might be able to use the distrust between them to outsmart them.
Dialog_Action_50002_122,As for my outsider friends... I used to hear this from the passing travelers that somewhere to the west was the Enclave's base camp.
Dialog_Action_50002_123,"But I don't know the specific direction... If you're lucky, maybe find its location from the Enclave's communications?"
Dialog_Action_50002_124,"It seems we've got to formulate a surprise plan... Thank you, Harold!"
Dialog_Action_34010510_101,"According to Hannibal's plan, the first step, we got to play the role of Slavers again."
Dialog_Action_34010510_102,"You know what, we've been playing the role since we arrived here. Do we really look the role we are playing?"
Dialog_Action_34010510_103,Haha! Sometimes it feels great to be a villain.
Dialog_Action_34010510_104,So what exactly are we going to play the Slavers for?
Dialog_Action_34010510_105,"Soon you will know... See, our audiences have come."
Dialog_Action_34010510_106,Freeze! Who are you guys?
Dialog_Action_34010510_107,We came over from the Paradise Falls and Boss says you need some reinforcements.
Dialog_Action_34010510_108,"Reinforcements? We didn't report on the need for reinforcements, did we?"
Dialog_Action_34010510_109,"Even if we did need reinforcements, it's not you Slavers."
Dialog_Action_34010510_110,Enough! I've had enough of you discriminating against us as ordinary Wastelanders!
Dialog_Action_34010510_111,"Whoa, whoa, just joking. Don't get mad."
Dialog_Action_34010510_112,"No, no, no, I'm totally fine. It's my little friend in my hand that's mad."
Dialog_Action_34010510_113,What? How dare you...
Dialog_Action_34010510_114,"Scout Squad E-43, attacked by Slavers. Repeat. Attacked by Slavers..."
Dialog_Action_34010510_115,"Nice job, the first step was done."
Dialog_Action_34010510_116,Aah! I see! Then the second step is to...
Dialog_Action_34010510_117,You're right!
Dialog_Action_34010610_101,"The second step of the plan, we're going to dress up as the Enclave to engage in a sabotage in this camp of Slavers."
Dialog_Action_34010610_102,"This time, of course, let us Abolitionists do it. We have to get it even with those Slavers. You just have to watch this good play quietly."
Dialog_Action_34010610_103,"Hannibal, are you sure you can deal with this kinetic armor? This high-tech stuff, are you not afraid to break it down?"
Dialog_Action_34010610_104,"Don't worry, just wearing it for a little while. Won't be a problem."
Dialog_Action_34010610_105,"Iron Cans of the Enclave, what are you doing here?"
Dialog_Action_34010610_106,Routine Check!
Dialog_Action_34010610_107,Routine Check? Didn't you come by in the morning?
Dialog_Action_34010610_108,Routine Check can't hurt. You savages can never be supervised enough!
Dialog_Action_34010610_109,What do you say! We're not savages!
Dialog_Action_34010610_110,"Hah! You guys are funny. Compared to the Enclave, aren't you the savages of the Stone Age?"
Dialog_Action_34010610_111,Arrrrgh! I've had enough of you arrogant Enclaves!
Dialog_Action_34010610_112,That's what you get by violating the Enclave! Who else wants a taste of this?
Dialog_Action_34010610_113,You! You! I'm gonna tell Boss!
Dialog_Action_34010610_114,Don't we have to chase?
Dialog_Action_34010610_115,"Don't have to. Let him embroider what happened here before his boss, and then we'll have a good show."
Dialog_Action_34010610_116,Now! Are you savages ready to repent?!
Dialog_Action_34010610_117,Watch me... Ouch!
Dialog_Action_34010610_118,How come this damn stuff won't move...
Dialog_Action_34010610_119,Sure enough he has broken the power suit. Let's go help him out!
Dialog_Action_34010610_120,That damn stuff is not reliable. Good to have you there.
Dialog_Action_34010610_121,This is the Enclave's high-tech...
Dialog_Action_34010610_122,"All in all, our plan is halfway through, and next we can open a bottle of Nuka-Cola and watch things ferment."
Dialog_Action_34010610_123,"As a result, they would be busy fighting each other, and the Oasis would be safe."
Dialog_Action_34010610_124,"And while they're in a mess, we can sneak into their base of operations to see if we can find information about the Enclave's base camp."
Dialog_Action_34010610_125,"Speaking of which, my scout told me that Slavers and the Enclave are gathering near the Broadcast Tower LP8 which is supposed to be their base of operations."
Dialog_Action_34010410_101,That loud explosion of this Broadcast Tower from afar. It seems our plan worked!
Dialog_Action_34010410_102,"The Enclave who sees Wastelanders as barbarians, and ruthless Slavers, really can't tell who will win."
Dialog_Action_34010410_103,"If they haven't battled it out, we'll take actions ahead."
Dialog_Action_34010410_104,"That's right, I'll ask the Abolitionists to create chaos on the periphery, and you'll take the opportunity to sneak into their communications center to see if something can be dug up."
Dialog_Action_34010410_105,They're really giving it all out...
Dialog_Action_34010410_106,Hardly expected our plan to work that smoothly.
Dialog_Action_34010410_107,Waste of no effort!
Dialog_Action_34010410_108,It's supposed to be the Enclave's communications center.
Dialog_Action_34010410_109,"Let me see what kind of hot stuff we can find out... Um... play the last message, that's it."
Dialog_Action_34010410_110,LP8 calling Ravenrock. LP8 calling Ravenrock.
Dialog_Action_34010410_111,"The alliance with the ground agents unexpectedly broke down, and the VIP02 recovery program failed. Transporting VIP01 with full power."
Dialog_Action_34010410_112,Request reinforcements. Repeat. Request reinforcements.
Dialog_Action_34010410_113,"We must evacuate quick. Although both the Enclave and the Slavers take a toll, the Slavers are never the Enclave's match."
Dialog_Action_34010410_114,"Soon their battle will be over, and hopefully you have found valuable information."
Dialog_Action_34010410_115,Does Ravenrock ring a bell to you?
Dialog_Action_34010410_116,Ravenrock? That's an inconspicuous little mound on the northwest... Could it be...
Dialog_Action_34010410_117,There's a good chance it is the Enclave's base camp.
Dialog_Action_34010410_118,It's unexpected news that the Enclave's base camp is under our nose? Hmm... I'm gonna notify the Abolitionists.
Dialog_Action_34010410_119,"We need to be ready too, and it seems there's a big battle awaiting us."
Dialog_Action_34010410_120,"Next stop, Ravenrock!"
Dialog_Action_800106100_101,"As usual, our story begins in a Vault..."
Dialog_Action_800106100_102,"It was another quiet and peaceful afternoon, when the Vault dwellers were suddenly notified of impending danger by alarms."
Dialog_Action_800106100_103,Uh... What happened? What is all this noise for?
Dialog_Action_800106100_104,"Demonic Threat detected, facilities locking down."
Dialog_Action_800106100_105,What's a Demonic Threat? Is that a new mutant creature?
Dialog_Action_800106100_106,We've seen worse. Let's get it over with so I can get back to my nap!
Dialog_Action_800106100_107,The dwellers didn't know what kind of nightmare they would be facing.
Dialog_Action_800106100_108,But they would soon find out.
Dialog_Action_800106100_109,These monsters...never quit!
Dialog_Action_800106100_110,"They don't seem to get tired or take damage like normal mutants.. We've killed so many of them, but they don't fear death at all! What should we do?"
Dialog_Action_800106100_111,It's like they're...from Hell!
Dialog_Action_800106100_112,"Seems the Vault dwellers have finally realized that the demons are a threat they've never seen before. In such a critical moment, who could save this Vault?"
Dialog_Action_800106100_113,"Wait, why they are cowering now?"
Dialog_Action_800106100_114,Do I hear metal music?
Dialog_Action_800106100_115,Oh my gosh!
Dialog_Action_800106100_116,The demons are no match for him!
Dialog_Action_800106100_117,Our hero! You're a life saver! Thanks! What's your name?!
Dialog_Action_800106100_118,...
Dialog_Action_800106100_119,"Hello, I'm AI VEGA. I've connected to your communication system. Now we can communicate freely."
Dialog_Action_800106100_120,"Um, hello?"
Dialog_Action_800106100_121,"Your world has been invaded by demons from Hell. They are brutal, ruthless, and restless. The only man they fear is the Doom Slayer, who you just met."
Dialog_Action_800106100_122,"Surface environment scan...complete. The Wasteland outside the Vault has been completely overrun by demons. With your help, the Doom Slayer will be able to shut down the Portals of Hell and rid the Wasteland of the Demonic Threat."
Dialog_Action_800106100_123,That's when the dwellers embarked on a new journey together with a warrior playing heavy metal music.
Dialog_Action_800106101_101,The Portals of Hell are powered by three Argent Energy Cores. Destroying these energy nodes will disable the Portals.
Dialog_Action_800106101_102,You're approaching the first energy node. I've detected powerful demon energy signals nearby. Brace yourself.
Dialog_Action_800106101_103,Doom Slayer! Let us handle this...
Dialog_Action_800106101_104,Doom Slayer...? Is he mute?...
Dialog_Action_800106101_105,He...doesn't talk much.
Dialog_Action_800106101_106,The first Argent Energy Core has been destroyed. I've detected that the demonic frequency levels in the Wasteland has dropped by 17.8%.
Dialog_Action_800106101_107,Strong demon energy signals have been detected near the two remaining nodes. We must hurry.
Dialog_Action_800106101_108,"Um, is this how the Doom Slayer closes portals?"
Dialog_Action_800106101_109,It gets the job done.
Dialog_Action_800106120_101,The second Argent Energy Core is nearby. Find it and destroy it.
Dialog_Action_800106120_102,You seem very familiar with how the portals work. Are you sure you're just a common AI?
Dialog_Action_800106120_103,"I was developed by Doctor Samuel Hayden and I can connect to most electronic intelligence systems. Doctor Hayden could provide more info for our course, but we are unable to locate him."
Dialog_Action_800106120_104,Doctor Hayden...sounds like a tough guy.
Dialog_Action_800106120_105,(The Doom Slayer lets out a hum of dissatisfaction)
Dialog_Action_800106120_106,"Um, seems the Doom Slayer doesn't like the doctor. I wonder why."
Dialog_Action_800106120_107,The second Argent Energy Core has been demolished. Now there's only one left.
Dialog_Action_800106120_108,The Doom Slayer really...hates demons...
Dialog_Action_800106120_109,But why?
Dialog_Action_800106120_110,"As far as I know, it's because demons killed his pet, but that may only be a legend."
Dialog_Action_800106125_101,The final Argent Energy Core is nearby. Find it.
Dialog_Action_800106125_102,Alert! Alert!
Dialog_Action_800106125_103,"The Doom Slayer has entered the facility. All units, attention!"
Dialog_Action_800106125_104,What? So the alarm is for the Doom Slayer?!
Dialog_Action_800106125_105,(The Doom Slayer lets out a hum of disappointment)
Dialog_Action_800106125_106,He was probably trying to surprise them...
Dialog_Action_800106125_107,The final Argent Energy Core has been broken. I've detected hordes of demons amassing in Trinity Tower.
Dialog_Action_800106125_108,That's where the biggest Portal to Hell stands. Destroy the Argent Energy Core to remove the portal's protection.
Dialog_Action_800106125_109,It's quite risky to attack the Portal head on. I suggest we infiltrate through the underground tunnels...
Dialog_Action_800106125_110,(The Doom Slayer lets out a hum of indifference)
Dialog_Action_800106125_111,I guess that's how he's not much of a 'planner'.
Dialog_Action_800106127_101,Huge energy wave detected near the Portal to Hell. Prepare for battle.
Dialog_Action_800106127_102,Where's the Doom Slayer? He can't miss this...
Dialog_Action_800106127_103,(Demons screaming from afar...)
Dialog_Action_800106127_104,"Ah, seems he's impatient."
Dialog_Action_800106127_105,"Too late, mortals. The portals are supplied with Argent Energy directly from Hell now."
Dialog_Action_800106127_106,My brothers will swarm into your world through the portals. Not even the Doom Slayer can stop them!
Dialog_Action_800106127_107,Accept your fate!
Dialog_Action_800106127_108,He's right. We can't cut off the energy from this side.
Dialog_Action_800106127_109,Only in Hell can we completely shut down the portals and put an end to the invasion.
Dialog_Action_800106127_110,(The Doom Slayer groans)
Dialog_Action_800106127_111,What now?
Dialog_Action_800106127_112,"I don't know, but my intuition tells me to follow that angry man."
Dialog_Action_800106127_113,So...we go to Hell?
Dialog_Action_800106127_114,"Thus, the dwellers followed the Doom Slayer into the Portal to Hell."
Dialog_Action_800106127_115,"Uh? What happens next? Heh, don't worry. That's another story."
Dialog_Action_800107100_101,Here is the ancient battlefield where the Night Sentinels fought the demons. Countless sentinels died here.
Dialog_Action_800107100_102,"Betrayer's life signal is not far, but massive demons are approaching too. They must know we're here."
Dialog_Action_800107100_103,(The Doom Slayer groans with indifference)
Dialog_Action_800107100_104,"Who could this ""Betrayer"" be? I can't believe someone called ""the Betrayer"" could be of any help."
Dialog_Action_800107100_105,"Name's Valen. He used to serve the Night Sentinels just like the Doom Slayer. Valen's son died in the war against the demons, which almost drove him mad."
Dialog_Action_800107100_106,"Cunning demons corrupted Valen, asking him to betray the Sentinels with the fake promise of his son's rebirth."
Dialog_Action_800107100_107,"Valen sold the source of power of the Sentinels, the Wraiths, to demons. Yet, the way they revived Valen's son was by twisting his soul and turning him into Titan: the Icon of Sin."
Dialog_Action_800107100_108,"Tormented by remorse and pain, the Betrayer banished himself forever in Hell. I guess he knows where the energy core of Hell lies. Destroy it and we'll close the portals once and for all."
Dialog_Action_800107100_109,"Oh, boy, this guy hates demons so much."
Dialog_Action_800107100_110,I thought I was hiding quite well... How did you find me?
Dialog_Action_800107100_111,It's you... What are you doing here?
Dialog_Action_800107100_112,(The Doom Slayer lets out a groan)
Dialog_Action_800107100_113,(The Betrayer takes a glance at the Wasteland dwellers)
Dialog_Action_800107100_114,They are not your kin... Saving them will not pacify your soul. It's just another burden.
Dialog_Action_800107100_115,(The Doom Slayer casts a cold stare at the Betrayer)
Dialog_Action_800107100_116,You... Will you defy Khan Maykr for them?
Dialog_Action_800107100_117,(The Doom Slayer stands still and says nothing)
Dialog_Action_800107100_118,"Fine... You're heading to Nekravol, the Soul Refinery of the nether world. There you'll find a portal leading to Urdak where you can cut off the transmission of Argent Energy."
Dialog_Action_800107100_119,Nekravol? Urdak? I have no idea...
Dialog_Action_800107100_120,I'll explain on the way.
Dialog_Action_800107113_101,We'll reach Nekravol after passing through this fortress.
Dialog_Action_800107113_102,"What is this ""Nekravol?"""
Dialog_Action_800107113_103,Nekravol is the Soul Refinery of Hell where captured mortal souls are tormented and refined with the Nether Fire. They're then then converted into...Argent Energy.
Dialog_Action_800107113_104,"The fortress we're in is called the ""Nether Prison"" where the dead are sorted. The valuable one are sent to the Soul Crucible while the ones deemed""Worthless"" discarded into the bottomless pit."
Dialog_Action_800107113_105,It sounds...pretty metal...
Dialog_Action_800107113_106,How do you know so much about this place?
Dialog_Action_800107113_107,"Before your world is invaded, this place was used to torture my people."
Dialog_Action_800107113_108,"The Night Sentinels used to attack the Refinery, and your friend the Doom Slayer was a part of the team too, but we failed...because of my meaningless betrayal."
Dialog_Action_800107113_109,"Our men were converted into Argent Energy one by one. And now, it's your turn."
Dialog_Action_800107113_110,"Excuse me, powerful demon energy signals have been detected nearby. They know we're coming."
Dialog_Action_800107113_111,(The Doom Slayer lifts his shotgun and heads to the citadel)
Dialog_Action_800107113_112,These monsters...
Dialog_Action_800107113_113,"Oh, man... They are the fabled Agaddon hunters, specially trained to hunt the Doom Slayer and the Night Sentinels."
Dialog_Action_800107113_114,Seems they have returned and...they're enhanced... Their only goal is to destroy the Doom Slayer!
Dialog_Action_800107113_115,Locked on to the Doom Slayer!!!
Dialog_Action_800107113_116,The path is clear. More demons are gathering in Nekravol. It will be a tough fight.
Dialog_Action_800107113_117,Bring them on! I'll gut them like fish!
Dialog_Action_800107113_118,Why do the demons want to protect the Soul Refinery so much?
Dialog_Action_800107113_119,"Argent Energy is the source of power for all demons, but they don't use much. The real master of the Soul Refinery is the Maykrs in Urdak."
Dialog_Action_800107113_120,The Maykrs' dependence on Argent Energy forces them to send all demon minions to protect Nekravol.
Dialog_Action_800107113_121,"Wait, what are the Maykrs? What's this Urdak?"
Dialog_Action_800107113_122,"You really want to hear my stories while we're surrounded by demons in Hell?... Fine, I'll tell on the way."
Dialog_Action_800107400_101,"This is the Soul Refinery of Nekravol where the dead are sent here to have their souls tortured, refined, and converted in to Argent Energy."
Dialog_Action_800107400_102,"Some Argent Energy is used to corrupt, twist, and reshape the flesh of the dead, turning them into the demons we've seen."
Dialog_Action_800107400_103,While most Argent Energy is transferred through the portal deep in Nekravol to Urdak: the realm of the Maykrs...
Dialog_Action_800107400_104,"The Maykrs...descended before us like angels long ago and inspired us with civilization and technologies, and we worshipped Khan Maykr like a god."
Dialog_Action_800107400_105,"But one day, a severely-wounded outlander came to our world, demons from Hell right on his tail. That outlander joined the Night Sentinels and helped us resist demon invasion..."
Dialog_Action_800107400_106,"Wait, are you saying...?"
Dialog_Action_800107400_107,"After he used the Crucible Blade to kill the mighty Titan, the outlander became the leader of Night Sentinels, and his name, the Doom Slayer, began to make demons tremble."
Dialog_Action_800107400_108,Indeed!
Dialog_Action_800107400_109,"But when the Doom Slayer led us into the depths of Hell, we discovered something..."
Dialog_Action_800107400_110,"Khan Maykr, the one we worshipped as a god, had made a deal with the demons."
Dialog_Action_800107400_111,"The Maykrs helped demons to conquer worlds with their technologies, while demons from Hell extracted souls from the victims and converted them into Argent Energy."
Dialog_Action_800107400_112,"The demons we faced in battle were once our fallen brothers, and the Khan Maykr used Argent Energy to sustain their realm, Urdak."
Dialog_Action_800107400_113,"Since then, the Night Sentinels were plunged into civil war. Some Sentinels gave in to the Maykrs and the power of the Argent Energy, while the Doom Slayer and the rest remained defiant..."
Dialog_Action_800107400_114,You already know...what happened next...
Dialog_Action_800107413_101,"This is the core of Soul Refinery: the Crucible. The portal here leads to Urdak. They say it's a paradise, but no sentinel made it there alive."
Dialog_Action_800107413_102,My journey ends here. You'll be on your own.
Dialog_Action_800107413_103,"Thanks for the help, Valen."
Dialog_Action_800107413_104,It's been a long time long since I was called that...
Dialog_Action_800107413_105,"Promise me, the Doom Slayer, if you see my son, help his soul find peace. That's the only way the deceased sentinels will be free of their torment."
Dialog_Action_800107413_106,(The Doom Slayer groans)
Dialog_Action_800107413_107,Lv.5 demon energy approaching! Prepare for battle!
Dialog_Action_800107413_108,"You're but a usurper, a fake idol."
Dialog_Action_800107413_109,(The Doom Slayer gazes coldly at the Marauder)
Dialog_Action_800107413_110,"Khan Maykr showed me true power. Let me open your eyes, Doom Slayer!"
Dialog_Action_800107413_111,"The portal leading to Urdak is clear, calculating path..."
Dialog_Action_800107413_112,Wait... A familiar signal...Doctor Hayden?!
Dialog_Action_800107413_113,(The Doom Slayer groans)
Dialog_Action_800107413_114,It's our turn. I wonder where this portal will take us... Are you scared?
Dialog_Action_800107413_115,"Huh, not even Hell can stand in our way now. The demons should be terrified!"
Dialog_Action_800107413_116,"Thus, the dwellers have overcome Hell. Now they are passing through the portal to Heaven... Will they meet angels there? What fearsome foes are waiting for the Doom Slayer?"
Dialog_Action_800107413_117,That...is a story for another day.
Dialog_Action_35010110_101,We're not far from Ravenrock. Guess we'll find our target soon if we pass Mason Dixon Salvage and head to the northwest along the hills.
Dialog_Action_35010110_102,"Hannibal, what is this place? I feel something's not right."
Dialog_Action_35010110_103,"Mason Dixon Salvage used to be an auto-recycling center. But it has been taken by a bunch super mutants. Stupid greenskins, nothing to worry about."
Dialog_Action_35010110_104,"But, not the greenskins, there seems to be something else lurking here..."
Dialog_Action_35010110_105,Did you hear it?
Dialog_Action_35010110_106,Yeah... I did...
Dialog_Action_35010110_107,Seems a monster...lives here...
Dialog_Action_35010110_108,Watch your steps. I've never heard something like this...
Dialog_Action_35010110_109,What the hell?!
Dialog_Action_35010110_110,"The thing looks like...piecing humans and some other creatures together... Oh, hell, nightmares..."
Dialog_Action_35010110_111,I've heard of it before. Wastelanders call them Centaurs. They're not born like this... It's because of some sort of terrible experiment...
Dialog_Action_35010110_112,Experiment? What kind of evil experiments could make something so gross?
Dialog_Action_35010110_113,I've never seen them with my own eyes... But they might have something to do with Enclave...
Dialog_Action_35010110_114,(Hannibal ponders for a moment)
Dialog_Action_35010110_115,"This is a big deal. I need to get more hands. I'm afraid I can no longer venture with you for a while, friends."
Dialog_Action_35010110_116,"Um... Alright, good luck!"
Dialog_Action_35010110_117,"If things go well, I'll be back with helpers."
Dialog_Action_35010110_118,"Ah, almost forgot."
Dialog_Action_35010110_119,"I suggest you find if there's any Enclave sentries around before reaching Ravenrock. Perhaps you may get safety codes or something from prying their mouths open. It will help, right?"
Dialog_Action_35010110_120,"OK, Hannibal, we'll do it."
Dialog_Action_35010310_101,This abandoned satcom base might have some supplies left. Perhaps we should explore it to see what we may find.
Dialog_Action_35010310_102,Hmm... I'm not sure... No human traces here... Perhaps we're not the first to come up with the idea.
Dialog_Action_35010310_103,"Relax, they might be a bunch of scavengers."
Dialog_Action_35010310_104,Enclave! What are they doing here?
Dialog_Action_35010310_105,Perhaps looking for some deep buried secrets. See? I told you it was fishy!
Dialog_Action_35010310_106,Wouldn't it be nice? They should have the latest pass code with them and we can look into what Enclave is up to.
Dialog_Action_35010310_107,"Right, good point."
Dialog_Action_35010310_108,Hurry! Copy all files and destroy the terminal! Leave nothing behind!
Dialog_Action_35010310_109,"But, Sir, has our mission here suspended? Why do we have to dispose of these files that have been here for 200 years?"
Dialog_Action_35010310_110,Think with your brain smaller than a mole's! It's just because our mission has been suspended that the property here can't be found by our enemies! Shut your trap and do the job!
Dialog_Action_35010310_111,"Yeah! Yes, Sir!"
Dialog_Action_35010310_112,"Hello, sorry to interrupt... We can't let you burn these precious archives to ash."
Dialog_Action_35010310_113,"It belongs in the museum!! Eh... Sorry, wrong line..."
Dialog_Action_35010310_114,"Alright, let's see what secret is hidden in the terminal they were trying to destroy!"
Dialog_Action_35010310_115,Let me see... NW-05a files... Enclave Sigma Squad files... Squad log... Aha! Communication files! It might come in handy...
Dialog_Action_35010310_116,"Squad Sigma, here's Ravenrock. The headquarter has analyzed your report. The ballistic weapons controlled by NW-05a have an unstable factor. Re-enabling it may cost more resources."
Dialog_Action_35010310_117,"The headquarter has decided to suspend Project ""Skyfire"" indefinitely... Repeat... Indefinite suspension for Project ""Skyfire""... We've made another plan to strike the ""Castle""."
Dialog_Action_35010310_118,You know what to do next.
Dialog_Action_35010310_119,"Seems this satcom was used to manipulate the super weapons nearby. Enclave tried to recontrol these weapons, but the plan was put aside."
Dialog_Action_35010310_120,"Their target is a place called ""The Castle""... What's that?"
Dialog_Action_35010310_121,Don't know... Hmm... Let me see what's more in there...
Dialog_Action_35010310_122,"Here! An Enclave safety code, though it's a bit old..."
Dialog_Action_35010310_123,No time to care about that. Let's hope it'll work!
Dialog_Action_35010510_101,"Here's Ravenrock, unimpressive at all... Enclave's base must be here..."
Dialog_Action_35010510_102,Finally we'll see their true faces.
Dialog_Action_35010510_103,"Security check launched, please enter the safety code."
Dialog_Action_35010510_104,Let's see if the code we've found works.
Dialog_Action_35010510_105,Checking safety code... Please wait...
Dialog_Action_35010510_106,Uh... Did you smell something?
Dialog_Action_35010510_107,Please wait...
Dialog_Action_35010510_108,I feel a bit drowsy...
Dialog_Action_35010510_109,"(The man in the front narrows his eyes, a cruel sneer at the corner of his lips.)"
Dialog_Action_35010510_110,We knew there is a bunch of outsiders messing around against Enclave. I just never thought you fools would fall into the trap so easily.
Dialog_Action_35010510_111,Who...are you?
Dialog_Action_35010510_112,"Hey, when it's the turn for the captive to ask? Only I can ask questions here."
Dialog_Action_35010510_113,"Who's your boss? Tell me the truth and I'll put you out of misery. But I do hope you got tight mouths, because I got some new methods of torture I'd like you to appreciate."
Dialog_Action_35010510_114,"Gosh, it sounds hurt..."
Dialog_Action_35010510_115,We'd like to tell you the truth. But actually we just came here on our own.
Dialog_Action_35010510_116,"Good, seems you've chosen torture!"
Dialog_Action_35010510_117,What's wrong?
Dialog_Action_35010510_118,"Sir, the locked lab animals in the RD escaped."
Dialog_Action_35010510_119,"Damn, I was just about to have fun... I'll leave them to you. Don't break them. I'll be back soon."
Dialog_Action_35010510_120,"Right, what about you now?"
Dialog_Action_35010510_121,Ahhh!
Dialog_Action_35010510_122,Fire! Fire!
Dialog_Action_35010510_123,Now! Or never!
Dialog_Action_35010510_124,Lucky. Seems Enclave is experimenting on animals. Now they get punished by their own evil deeds.
Dialog_Action_35010510_125,Don't you think it's a bit coincidental? Things can't be so simple.
Dialog_Action_35010510_126,"Anyway, we must get out of here while Enclave is busy with those animals."
Dialog_Action_35010510_127,"Hush, easy, big guy, the sun is about to set..."
Dialog_Action_35010510_128,"(Murmuring) Damn, why do we have to watch this blasted terminal even now? Is it so important?"
Dialog_Action_35010510_129,I hate the job... Ahhhh!
Dialog_Action_35010510_130,Seems they got important files in that terminal. Let's seize the opportunity.
Dialog_Action_35010510_131,"Let me see... Hmm... The file says Enclave was heavily battered by a ""wanderer"" and their ""president"" and most elites were all destroyed."
Dialog_Action_35010510_132,But they don't look like they were ruined once. Look at their base running at full load and those high-tech equipment...
Dialog_Action_35010510_133,"Wait, here's more... It seems Enclave has transferred their remaining forces to the underground and is preparing for their ""Great Return""... Ravenrock is just one of their temporary bases... Other bases...seem to be scattered all over the wasteland."
Dialog_Action_35010510_134,"Even with the remaining influence, Enclave is still a big threat. I think we need more allies to rally against them."
Dialog_Action_35010510_135,"Sure, but didn't we forget something?... Shouldn't we be running now? We'll save it for later!"
Dialog_Action_35010510_136,This looks like a secret passage! Let's get out of here!
Dialog_Action_35010510_137,(Animal roaring from afar)
Dialog_Action_35010510_138,"If it weren't for the lab animals, we'd be dead already."
Dialog_Action_35010510_139,"Right, and they suffered much more than we did. I can imagine their hatred against Enclave."
Dialog_Action_35010510_140,We could have saved more of them.
Dialog_Action_35010510_141,Watch yourself! Let's go!
Dialog_Action_36010110_101,We might find some supplies here in this Mass Hall...
Dialog_Action_36010110_102,Hope we can fetch a few bottles of Nuka-Cola. I haven't had a drop for days!
Dialog_Action_36010110_103,Nuka-Cola? Don't forget we still have the Enclave on our tails!
Dialog_Action_36010110_104,Wait... I seem to have heard a gunshot. Seems we're not alone.
Dialog_Action_36010110_105,Get out! You can't hide forever!
Dialog_Action_36010110_106,One on one if you have guts! You take us all!
Dialog_Action_36010110_107,Ahhhh! I'll gut you if I find you!
Dialog_Action_36010110_108,Seems these bandits are in the middle of a trouble. We can ambush them.
Dialog_Action_36010110_109,Coward! Cheap sniper!
Dialog_Action_36010110_110,Blast!
Dialog_Action_36010110_111,"No matter who the sniper is, he must hate raiders very much."
Dialog_Action_36010110_112,"Perhaps he can be our ally. A foe's foe is a friend, right?"
Dialog_Action_36010110_113,"Yeah, but we'd better be careful. He may take us as raiders."
Dialog_Action_36010110_114,Phew... You son of... Where are you...?
Dialog_Action_36010110_115,I'll cut...your head off...
Dialog_Action_36010110_116,"Come out, I see you. If I wanted to kill you, you'd be dead bodies already."
Dialog_Action_36010110_117,"Hello, friend."
Dialog_Action_36010110_118,Seems you're enemy to raiders just like us. Care to journey together?
Dialog_Action_36010110_119,"Sorry, I travel alone. You'll be but a hindrance."
Dialog_Action_36010110_120,Normally every guy I met would like to kill me. But you guys seem a little friendlier than those bandits. So I'll just walk it off.
Dialog_Action_36010110_121,"Um, alright!"
Dialog_Action_36010110_122,(The wanderer frowns as if he thinks of something.) It seems you'll be staying around for a while. Word of advice.
Dialog_Action_36010110_123,Oh? What?
Dialog_Action_36010110_124,"A tough monster has appeared here. If you happen to run into it, run for your lives."
Dialog_Action_36010110_125,"Oh, don't worry. We'll keep ourselves safe."
Dialog_Action_36010110_126,"No, you get wrong. That monster is my prey. If you interfere with my hunt, you'll have my bullets."
Dialog_Action_36010110_127,Don't forget.
Dialog_Action_36010110_128,How rude!
Dialog_Action_36010110_129,The monster he said... What do you know?
Dialog_Action_36010110_130,Nothing... Hannibal is missing and we're strange to this place... Let's just move forward like headless flies for now...
Dialog_Action_36010310_101,No word from Hannibal for so long... I wonder if something has happened to the abolitionists.
Dialog_Action_36010310_102,"If you spent more time looking for food instead of worrying about others, we would have been starving these days."
Dialog_Action_36010310_103,"If you spent more time scavenging than blaming me, we'd be rich enough to open a salvage station in the Capital Wasteland."
Dialog_Action_36010310_104,Ha!
Dialog_Action_36010310_105,Look who's death-seeking fool here! Supplies and I'll make it quick for you!
Dialog_Action_36010310_106,See? Your loud yell has brought raiders to our doorstep.
Dialog_Action_36010310_107,We'd have found their camp if you were a bit more alert!
Dialog_Action_36010310_108,It's all your fault!
Dialog_Action_36010310_109,"No, it's you!"
Dialog_Action_36010310_110,Cut it out. Save the peace for your last moment...
Dialog_Action_36010310_111,Who's are you to meddle in our business?
Dialog_Action_36010310_112,Don't poke your nose in here! You blind idiot!
Dialog_Action_36010310_113,I...was just trying to be nice... (Sobbing) Even my dad never scolded me like that...
Dialog_Action_36010310_114,Shut up!
Dialog_Action_36010310_115,Hey! Aren't you the barbarians who escaped from Ravenrock a few days ago?
Dialog_Action_36010310_116,Seems you're lost. Need a ride home?
Dialog_Action_36010310_117,"Sir, orders from Ravenrock, we must exterminate them..."
Dialog_Action_36010310_118,I know! Corporal! You got no sense of humor! You ruined my line!
Dialog_Action_36010310_119,So...sorry... Sir!
Dialog_Action_36010310_120,"Watch and learn. Well, where were we..."
Dialog_Action_36010310_121,What's that sound? Your belly?
Dialog_Action_36010310_122,Sir! My belly has gone through harsh training of Enclave and it never growls on a mission!
Dialog_Action_36010310_123,"How curious, what could it be...?"
Dialog_Action_36010310_124,"Huh, didn't see that coming..."
Dialog_Action_36010310_125,Damn! Too fast!
Dialog_Action_36010310_126,"You didn't step into my hunt, well done. I'm gonna stalk my prey. Don't come. It's mine!"
Dialog_Action_36010310_127,That deathclaw is his prey?
Dialog_Action_36010310_128,That monster...looks familiar...
Dialog_Action_36010310_129,Should we go and check it out?
Dialog_Action_36010310_130,But he was serious about telling us not to interfere. It might get him mad...
Dialog_Action_36010310_131,Huh! Isn't it more fun? I hate rude guys!
Dialog_Action_36010510_101,You sure this is the right way? I feel it's a terrible place.
Dialog_Action_36010510_102,I'm pretty sure the wanderer is in this cave. He looks prepared to get the monster. He wouldn't cover up his footprints.
Dialog_Action_36010510_103,Really? Then we'll be in big trouble. The cave looks like a den to deathclaws... And we're like food on delivery.
Dialog_Action_36010510_104,Isn't the wanderer the first delivery? Don't worry. We'll be back soon from the 10-minute adventure!
Dialog_Action_36010510_105,Hope your mouth won't get us in trouble...
Dialog_Action_36010510_106,Got you!
Dialog_Action_36010510_107,"Hmm, did we miss the part?"
Dialog_Action_36010510_108,I told you not to follow... Never mind. The monster's is under my control now. I need...
Dialog_Action_36010510_109,(The wanderer spits) Bah! He's still resisting. Let me finish him...
Dialog_Action_36010510_110,Hold on!
Dialog_Action_36010510_111,I was right... This is not a normal deathclaw.
Dialog_Action_36010510_112,You're testing my patience... What do you mean?
Dialog_Action_36010510_113,"Look at these wounds. Except for the scars from battle, the deathclaw got a lot from experiments."
Dialog_Action_36010510_114,You mean...
Dialog_Action_36010510_115,"Right, he is one of the lab animals that raised hell back in Ravenrock... He's from Ravenrock!"
Dialog_Action_36010510_116,No wonder he was so mad with the Enclave soldiers we met!
Dialog_Action_36010510_117,Very good. But for me he's just a cunning prey.
Dialog_Action_36010510_118,You finished? I'll do it.
Dialog_Action_36010510_119,...
Dialog_Action_36010510_120,"Sorry, we can't let you. The deathclaw, to some extent, is our life saver. We can't stand and watch him die like this."
Dialog_Action_36010510_121,I warned you not to interfere.
Dialog_Action_36010510_122,I think your threat is useless... Since you're outnumbered.
Dialog_Action_36010510_123,"...Well, I'll remember this."
Dialog_Action_36010510_124,This guy looks serious. We'd better be careful.
Dialog_Action_36010510_125,Let him go. Let's rescue the deathclaw.
Dialog_Action_36010510_126,He got many deathclaw brothers in this cave. Why he seems to be isolated?
Dialog_Action_36010510_127,Perhaps these wild deathclaws wouldn't accept a lab animal as their kin... Poor thing... He wanted to find where he longs... It has turned out he's still alone...
Dialog_Action_36010510_128,"He can only count on us now... He's heavily wounded. But with Stimpaks and Buffouts, he may restore some stamina as his adrenaline gets simulated."
Dialog_Action_36010510_129,"Alright, it's up to him now."
Dialog_Action_36010510_130,(The monster stands up after twitching for a while. He nods his head and stumbles away.)
Dialog_Action_36010510_131,He doesn't talk. But I can feel his gratitude.
Dialog_Action_36010510_132,Seems we got a deathclaw friend. Hope we'll meet again in this strange Capital Wasteland.
Dialog_Action_800113101_101,(Preston frowns with his face grim.)
Dialog_Action_800113101_102,"Preston, vengeance shall come soon. Why you look so upset?"
Dialog_Action_800113101_103,My heart is always heavy knowing here lies countless Minutemen brothers in Quincy.
Dialog_Action_800113101_104,I'm sure we'll find Clint soon.
Dialog_Action_800113101_105,Clint is cunning and an opportunist. Don't underestimate him...
Dialog_Action_800113101_106,We've entered the territory of Gunners. Keep stealth and don't wake that sleeping dog.
Dialog_Action_800113101_107,Rest assured. Nobody's gonna find us if we get rid of them all.
Dialog_Action_800113101_108,Hush. Something over there. Let's hear it out for intel.
Dialog_Action_800113101_109,You heard it? Some brothers went missing recently. Clint is sending men to investigate.
Dialog_Action_800113101_110,"Come on, nothing weird people get missing here... Why such big fuss?"
Dialog_Action_800113101_111,"No, no, no... You don't know... I heard they just...evaporated..."
Dialog_Action_800113101_112,What? It sounds like the Institute's doing. Those sneaky bastards like to steal people...and turn them in to synth spies.
Dialog_Action_800113101_113,Perhaps... But yesterday Tesha told me Clint is tracking a mystery source of signal... Maybe it's related?
Dialog_Action_800113101_114,"Honestly, I don't give a damn. One gunner lost, one more share for me."
Dialog_Action_800113101_115,What... What about me?
Dialog_Action_800113101_116,"Um, I mean, we're good brothers!"
Dialog_Action_800113101_117,You don't have to worry about it...since you both will die here!
Dialog_Action_800113101_118,Seems the Gunners got their own trouble.
Dialog_Action_800113101_119,Don't know what's going on... But we'll definitely find Clint following the thread.
Dialog_Action_800111112_101,Keep working! We're not far from the signal!
Dialog_Action_800111112_102,"Chief, we've been following it for three days... Brothers would like to know more about it!"
Dialog_Action_800111112_103,Do I look like I got time to explain?... Actually I don't know either... But we'll find out when we get it!
Dialog_Action_800111112_104,But...
Dialog_Action_800111112_105,Shut trap!
Dialog_Action_800111112_106,(Sobs)
Dialog_Action_800111112_107,Shut your trap! I mean it! I heard something! Hell! Invaders! Fire!
Dialog_Action_800111112_108,Hold them off! I'm leaving!
Dialog_Action_800111112_109,Damn! Stop!
Dialog_Action_800111112_110,Damn it. They got away!
Dialog_Action_800111112_111,It's ok. He can't be far. The guy's tracking a signal and it should be in Quincy.
Dialog_Action_800111112_112,"It's never too late to avenge. Preston, be patient."
Dialog_Action_800111112_113,"Well, hope you're right."
Dialog_Action_800113128_101,My Pip-Boy has been beeping... There seems to be a strange signal source here.
Dialog_Action_800113128_102,Could it be what Clint's looking for? Finally...we'll get him.
Dialog_Action_800113128_103,"Easy, Preston. Don't make a fuss. We don't know what Clint's hiding up in his sleeves."
Dialog_Action_800113128_104,To hell with stealth! He can't run! I'll finish him off myself!
Dialog_Action_800113128_105,Wait!
Dialog_Action_800113128_106,"No, we gotta stop him."
Dialog_Action_800113128_107,"Got you, Clint. Didn't see it coming, did you?!"
Dialog_Action_800113128_108,Don't get close! You don't know what's here...
Dialog_Action_800113128_109,My Minutemen brothers who died in Quincy are waiting for you in hell!
Dialog_Action_800113128_110,"No... No, you don't get it!"
Dialog_Action_800113128_111,"Preston, wait, something's wrong..."
Dialog_Action_800113128_112,I've been waiting for this day!
Dialog_Action_800113128_113,"So long, Clint!"
Dialog_Action_800113128_114,Wha...what??! I feel bad...
Dialog_Action_800113128_115,What's this? Eh... Did they just disappear?
Dialog_Action_800113128_116,All that work for this? What a stupid story of revenge!
Dialog_Action_800113128_117,Calm yourself! At least Preston didn't forgive Clint after having his two fingers bit off!
Dialog_Action_800113128_118,"(Rolling eyes) Um, let's go. I just want to get back to the Vault, drink a bottle of Nuka-Cola and sleep for three days."
Dialog_Action_37010110_101,Everyone from the Commonwealth Wasteland! How are you?!
Dialog_Action_37010110_102,Hannibal! At last!
Dialog_Action_37010110_103,We thought something had happened to you! Or you abandoned us!
Dialog_Action_37010110_104,Haha! I just went to find some helpers. Seems you were busy while I was away.
Dialog_Action_37010110_105,Tell me about it. We barely ran out of the Enclave base...
Dialog_Action_37010110_106,Speaking of it... Come and see my friends. They're interested in those centaurs and Enclave.
Dialog_Action_37010110_107,"Paladin Glade, glad to you meet. This is Knight Colvin."
Dialog_Action_37010110_108,You from the Brotherhood of Steel?
Dialog_Action_37010110_109,"Yeah, the Brotherhood of Steel to the east. The special squad of Lyons Pride."
Dialog_Action_37010110_110,"The Brotherhood is very concerned with Enclave's recent activities. We should have destroyed them long ago... So Elder Lyons sent us, his most trusted warriors, here to investigate."
Dialog_Action_37010110_111,Those centaurs Hannibal mentioned are also causing troubles. Heard they got the size of a deathclaw... Normally they can't be so big.
Dialog_Action_37010110_112,"Alright, let's get to the point. Commoners, we need to build a temporary campground. Me and Colvin will clear the raiders nearby and you seize the chance to get their boss."
Dialog_Action_37010110_113,"Colvin, ready to go?"
Dialog_Action_37010110_114,"Born ready, Glade, as always."
Dialog_Action_37010110_115,"Good job, commoners. Seems the raiders are no match for you."
Dialog_Action_37010110_116,But here comes the big part. We'll start a overall investigation on mutants in this area. Let's begin with Rockbreaker's Last Gas overrun by mutants.
Dialog_Action_37010110_117,"With the help of Brotherhood, you should be safe for now. Friend, I'll ask the abolitionists to keep watching Enclave. So long."
Dialog_Action_37010110_118,"See you, Hannibal."
Dialog_Action_37010110_119,Hannibal... The old man is still tough as he used to be.
Dialog_Action_37010110_120,He's a man with dreams. May God bless him.
Dialog_Action_37010110_121,"Alright, now we'll head to the territory of mutants. Are you ready, commoners?"
Dialog_Action_37010110_122,"Always ready, Paladin. Always ready!"
Dialog_Action_37010310_101,"Commoners, I'll break their lines with Colvin. You watch minor resistances. After we clearing them off, we'll rally up and start the investigation."
Dialog_Action_37010310_102,Twisted mutant souls shall rest in peace soon.
Dialog_Action_37010310_103,"Alright, Colvin, time to show. Let our commoner friends see how Lyons Pride does it! Ad victoriam!"
Dialog_Action_37010310_104,Ad victoriam!
Dialog_Action_37010310_105,(Explosions and screams of super mutants can be heard from afar.)
Dialog_Action_37010310_106,Warriors of Lyons Pride are...pretty pepped!
Dialog_Action_37010310_107,We can't fall back... Let's go!
Dialog_Action_37010310_108,"Glade, flank!"
Dialog_Action_37010310_109,Leave it to me.
Dialog_Action_37010310_110,"Feels like GNR Radio back then, right?"
Dialog_Action_37010310_111,We got different memories about GNR Radio. One of us must have his head bashed...
Dialog_Action_37010310_112,Huh!
Dialog_Action_37010310_113,The signal of FEV sample points to Vault 87 to the south.
Dialog_Action_37010310_114,Curses. Shouldn't we have rid it of mutants years ago?
Dialog_Action_37010310_115,I guess someone must have re-launched the experiment there... And I guess everyone knows who that is.
Dialog_Action_37010310_116,"Commoners, we'll go to Vault 87 to investigate these new-type centaurs. The mission is dangerous. You don't have to come with us."
Dialog_Action_37010310_117,I wonder what story we'll miss.
Dialog_Action_37010310_118,Don't worry. We can protect ourselves.
Dialog_Action_37010310_119,Then see you in Vault 87!
Dialog_Action_37010510_101,Ew! I can smell the stink of mutants even in the power armor. Here must be their den.
Dialog_Action_37010510_102,Let's send these wretched souls to meet their maker!
Dialog_Action_37010510_103,"Commoners, time for a history lesson."
Dialog_Action_37010510_104,"Vault 87 was the source of those greenskins in the Capital Wasteland. But 10 years ago, the Brotherhood cleansed the place of evil."
Dialog_Action_37010510_105,But these active mutants and centaurs suggest that someone has restarted the FEV experiment in Vault 87.
Dialog_Action_37010510_106,Enclave must be involved.
Dialog_Action_37010510_107,"Right, but they're hiding in the dark. We must be fully prepared before the Brotherhood acts."
Dialog_Action_37010510_108,The ambush this time allows us to collect much info.
Dialog_Action_37010510_109,Got it. Let's do it. I can't wait to kill some greenskins!
Dialog_Action_37010510_110,"Warriors of the Brotherhood, please cease your fire. I'm not your enemy."
Dialog_Action_37010510_111,"Colvin, hold your weapon. The guy looks familiar."
Dialog_Action_37010510_112,"You look like elite soldiers of Lyons Pride. We should have a common friend, that lone wanderer."
Dialog_Action_37010510_113,"Wait, you mean... You're Fox?"
Dialog_Action_37010510_114,Right.
Dialog_Action_37010510_115,Seems friendly mutants are not that rare as we expected.
Dialog_Action_37010510_116,"Fox, why a mutant like you is in this hell? The Brotherhood nearly opened holes on you."
Dialog_Action_37010510_117,"In my recent journey, I found those abnormal centaurs are...evil. We must find out the truth."
Dialog_Action_37010510_118,Then we have a common goal.
Dialog_Action_37010510_119,Join us. More strength in numbers.
Dialog_Action_37010510_120,Good. I'll clear a passage for you.
Dialog_Action_37010510_121,"Hey, that's Brotherhood's job. Colvin, let's go!"
Dialog_Action_37010510_122,Stop! Who's there!?
Dialog_Action_37010510_123,Ah!
Dialog_Action_37010510_124,"Glade, are you alright?!"
Dialog_Action_37010510_125,"Nothing, it's just a scratch. They are mercenaries. We must catch up with them."
Dialog_Action_37010510_126,"Something's fishy here. We must be cautious. I think we should report to Lyons first. And you need time to recover, Glade."
Dialog_Action_37010510_127,"Your friend's right. Get some rest, Paladin."
Dialog_Action_37010510_128,But the mercenaries...
Dialog_Action_37010510_129,"Don't worry. I used to see them while I was travelling with the Lone Wanderer. I know they're mercenaries of Talon Company, lurking at Fort Bannister."
Dialog_Action_37010510_130,"I'll go investigate Talon Company with your commoner friends, leaving less traces behind."
Dialog_Action_37010510_131,"Right, a mutant and a bunch of weary visitors should look much lower than shining tins."
Dialog_Action_37010510_132,"Well, good luck then!"
Dialog_Action_38010110_101,This is an outpost of Talon Company. Perhaps we may disguise as merchants to talk with them.
Dialog_Action_38010110_102,I don't think it's a good idea.
Dialog_Action_38010110_103,"Hello, we're merchants passing by, we..."
Dialog_Action_38010110_104,Suspicious invaders! Fire!
Dialog_Action_38010110_105,Roger!
Dialog_Action_38010110_106,They don't talk!
Dialog_Action_38010110_107,"Talon Company only takes orders from their employers. We're under indiscriminate attack, which means they got a very powerful employer."
Dialog_Action_38010110_108,Here... I found a letter.
Dialog_Action_38010110_109,"Let me see... It says ""rendezvous at VAPL-58 Power Plant"". They're going to see their employer!"
Dialog_Action_38010110_110,"We must hurry. VAPL-58 Power Plant is plagued with giant ants. If we're late and they got attacked by giant ants, we may lose our thread."
Dialog_Action_38010110_111,"You're quite a thoughtful mutant, Fox."
Dialog_Action_38010110_112,Thanks. It's pure luck that I could save my sanity from mutation. Traveling with that lone wanderer taught me to think before acting.
Dialog_Action_38010110_113,"You should see the ""Lone Wanderer"" if chance permits."
Dialog_Action_38010110_114,Maybe...he has gone missing for long.
Dialog_Action_38010310_101,"Aha, here's the place of giant ants. It reminds me of an old song."
Dialog_Action_38010310_102,"""I can't dance, I got ants in my pants?"" That was over 200 years ago!"
Dialog_Action_38010310_103,"Back then ants were not so big, and they didn't breathe fire either."
Dialog_Action_38010310_104,"Hahaha, that was quite long ago."
Dialog_Action_38010310_105,"Alright, let's get to the point. Giant ants are dangerous. We must tread lightly."
Dialog_Action_38010310_106,Seems we're outrun by giant ants.
Dialog_Action_38010310_107,"Damn, the thread is broken again?"
Dialog_Action_38010310_108,Perhaps not. Check the dead body here.
Dialog_Action_38010310_109,An Enclave soldier!
Dialog_Action_38010310_110,So the client of Talon Company is Enclave? No surprises at all.
Dialog_Action_38010310_111,Now we know the one behind the curtain. But what's their purpose? Remember those slavers? They got deal with Enclave too.
Dialog_Action_38010310_112,Hiring scums in the Capital Wasteland to do the dirty work while hiding in the dark... Sounds Enclave enough...
Dialog_Action_38010310_113,We should head to Fort Bannister. That's one of Talon Company bases.
Dialog_Action_38010310_114,"The best we could talk the boss of Talon Company into stopping their cooperation with Enclave. Well, the worst, we could clear off the local forces of Talon Company and weaken Enclave's power."
Dialog_Action_38010310_115,Then we'd better prepare for the worst. I don't expect those mercenaries to listen.
Dialog_Action_38010510_101,Halt! This is trespassing! I'm going to open fire!
Dialog_Action_38010510_102,"Wait, the commander said she's expecting contacts of our employer... Could they be...?"
Dialog_Action_38010510_103,What's going on?
Dialog_Action_38010510_104,"Sir, these strangers just broke in our fort."
Dialog_Action_38010510_105,Then why didn't you kill them?
Dialog_Action_38010510_106,But you said you're waiting for contacts from the employer. I think it could be them.
Dialog_Action_38010510_107,Idiot! Don't you see that mutant? How could our employer mingle with mutants?
Dialog_Action_38010510_108,Finish them off! I'm in the middle of something important!
Dialog_Action_38010510_109,You heard that. So...
Dialog_Action_38010510_110,Cough... Seems we're going to have a tough fight.
Dialog_Action_38010510_111,You broke in Fort Bannister and killed many of my men. What do you want?
Dialog_Action_38010510_112,We want you Talon Company to stop cooperating with Enclave.
Dialog_Action_38010510_113,How did you...
Dialog_Action_38010510_114,"Ahem, even we're doing it, why should we listen to you? Talon Company fulfills contracts."
Dialog_Action_38010510_115,Think about it! Enclave never regard wastelanders on the surface as humans. You will be sorry one day dealing with them.
Dialog_Action_38010510_116,"No matter what they've promised, they will betray you sooner or later."
Dialog_Action_38010510_117,It's not late to regret. Enclave got no morals.
Dialog_Action_38010510_118,"But if you don't listen, we can play it tough."
Dialog_Action_38010510_119,(Harton ponders for a while)
Dialog_Action_38010510_120,"Sorry, you may have made some sense... Least better than my stupid subordinates... But I told you we don't betray the employer."
Dialog_Action_38010510_121,"Even if I did, my boss would have me killed!"
Dialog_Action_38010510_122,So...
Dialog_Action_38010510_123,Prepare to die! Scums!
Dialog_Action_38010510_124,What a shame. Thought their boss would be more reasonable.
Dialog_Action_38010510_125,"Commoners, glad to see you're fine."
Dialog_Action_38010510_126,We followed your footsteps to the fort and thought you'd be in danger. Never expected you'd terminate all these mercenaries. Impressive.
Dialog_Action_38010510_127,It's nothing. We just did what we do.
Dialog_Action_38010510_128,Brotherhood thank you for your contribution to the Capital Wasteland.
Dialog_Action_38010510_129,"Well, let's get to business. We have sufficient proof that shows Enclave is restarting the FEV experiment. And they're hiring thugs for dirty work."
Dialog_Action_38010510_130,They're planning a big return. That's for sure.
Dialog_Action_38010510_131,"The Brotherhood has carried out a full-scale operation, searching their underground bases and cutting off their connections to their allies on the surface."
Dialog_Action_38010510_132,"We need some time to deploy our troops, during which you may walk around the Capital Wasteland. We'll inform you once we got intel."
Dialog_Action_38010510_133,Great. Perhaps we can take a vacation?
Dialog_Action_38010510_134,Of course. Remember when we had our last vacation?
Dialog_Action_800109313_101,Thanks. May the Power of the Atom bless you.
Dialog_Action_800109313_102,Some of our brothers couldn't take it and went back to the embrace of atom. May they find peace.
Dialog_Action_800109313_103,"Uh, you know your way back?"
Dialog_Action_800109313_104,"Of course, friend. We'll soon be back to the Atom Pit."
Dialog_Action_800109324_101,"Thanks, friends. We're on a pilgrimage from Far Harbor to the Church of Atom here. Never thought we'd get caught by raiders."
Dialog_Action_800109324_102,You're not local? You have...brothers and sisters...somewhere else?
Dialog_Action_800109324_103,Of course. Blessings of the Church of Atom fill the whole wasteland. Come to Far Harbor and feel the power of atom if you're interested.
Dialog_Action_800109324_104,We'll see... Um...
Dialog_Action_800109317_101,Thanks for your help...
Dialog_Action_800109317_102,How did you get here?
Dialog_Action_800109317_103,The raiders holding us captive were attacked by atomic creation. We escaped but lost our way... Ended up in a monster's den.
Dialog_Action_800109317_104,Didn't the Power of the Atom guide you?
Dialog_Action_800109317_105,Perhaps we're not faithful enough. We must pray harder once we're back to the Atom Pit.
Dialog_Action_800109317_106,Suit yourself.
Dialog_Action_990700001_101,"Dogmeat, can I trouble you to help me again?"
Dialog_Action_990700001_102,(Expectantly) Woof!
Dialog_Action_990700001_103,"This time, we are looking for a missing old lady, can you find some clues?"
Dialog_Action_990700001_104,(Confidently) Woo-woof!
Dialog_Action_990700001_105,Good boy.
Dialog_Action_990700001_106,"There are so many enemies here, it may be very dangerous for you. <color=#f0615dFF>Try to avoid unnecessary battles</color> and make use of your abilities!"
Dialog_Action_990700001_107,(Defiantly) Woof!
Dialog_Action_990700001_108,(Dogmeat instinctively feels that<color=#f0615dFF> he has a way to bypass these powerful enemies ahead</color>.)
Dialog_Action_990700001_109,(Dogmeat searches carefully)
Dialog_Action_990700001_110,Woof-woof!
Dialog_Action_990700001_111,"What is this, A piece of a scarf? Can you find the whereabouts of the old lady based on the scarf's scent?"
Dialog_Action_990700001_112,(Definitely) Woof!
Dialog_Action_990700001_113,"Good boy, let's go!"
Dialog_Action_990700002_101,"Hmm... It seems that this cave is quite dangerous, Dogmeat. Remember to be careful."
Dialog_Action_990700002_102,(Excitedly) Woof!
Dialog_Action_990700002_103,Woof!
Dialog_Action_990700002_104,"That's right, if we <color=#f0615dFF>stay aware of our surroundings, we can avoid danger</color>."
Dialog_Action_990700002_105,"What a good clever boy, Dogmeat!"
Dialog_Action_990700002_106,"(Dogmeat hesitates for a moment, his gut tells him that there is danger nearby.)"
Dialog_Action_990700002_107,(He is keenly aware of where the danger is coming from. He's prepared)
Dialog_Action_990700002_108,It seems that we're one step behind. This old lady is really hard to find.
Dialog_Action_990700002_109,Woof!
Dialog_Action_990700002_110,"What did you say? Ah, yes, these missing slippers, they look like they were dropped by an elderly woman."
Dialog_Action_990700002_111,"Very good! It seems that by following this clue, we can continue to track that old lady."
Dialog_Action_990700002_112,(Definitely) Woof!
Dialog_Action_990700003_101,(Excitedly) Woo-woof!
Dialog_Action_990700003_102,Oh? It seems we are very close to the old lady.
Dialog_Action_990700003_103,(Sticks out his tongue happily.)
Dialog_Action_990700003_104,"Be careful Dogmeat, there seems to be a lot of patrol robots here."
Dialog_Action_990700003_105,Woof!
Dialog_Action_990700003_106,"You must be the old lady we are looking for. You've definitely got some speed left in those wheels, you were hard to catch up to!"
Dialog_Action_990700003_107,"Ah, I remember having some Mentats last night... and then... I just woke up here, no idea how..."
Dialog_Action_990700003_108,"... Well fortunately, Dogmeat's nose helped us find you, and just in the nick of time. After all, this place is quite dangerous."
Dialog_Action_990700003_109,(Touches Dogmeat's chin) Is your name Dogmeat? What a good boy!
Dialog_Action_990700003_110,(Happily) Woof!
Dialog_Action_990700003_111,Dogmeat... I can see... the Minutemen need your help. You will help them find a new home.
Dialog_Action_990700003_112,(Tilts his head questioningly)
Dialog_Action_990700003_113,Let's take you home right away! This is no place to chat.
Dialog_Action_990700004_101,Woof!
Dialog_Action_990700004_102,Is this... a dog? Was he raised by Gunners?
Dialog_Action_990700004_103,"Hold on, I heard from Grandma Murphy that we'll meet an unexpected ally... His name seems to be... Dogmeat?"
Dialog_Action_990700004_104,(Excitedly) Woof!
Dialog_Action_990700004_105,So your name is Dogmeat? I thought Grandma Murphy was joking with us...
Dialog_Action_990700004_106,"Good dog! We're being chased by Gunners, can you help us find a safe route?"
Dialog_Action_990700004_107,(Definitely) Woof!
Dialog_Action_990700004_108,"You're our hero, Dogmeat! If we can get out of here alive, I will guarantee you a whole years worth of dog chow!"
Dialog_Action_990700004_109,(Dogmeat looks around)
Dialog_Action_990700004_110,Woof! Woof!
Dialog_Action_990700004_111,It seems safe here... I didn't expect to be saved by a dog.
Dialog_Action_990700004_112,(Proudly) Woof!
Dialog_Action_990700004_113,"He seems to be saying ""It was nothing!"" What a clever dog!"
Dialog_Action_990700004_114,"We are very close to the Sanctuary Hills. Once we get there, we should be able to find shelter."
Dialog_Action_990700005_101,"Those robbers are still after us, I can't take it anymore!"
Dialog_Action_990700005_102,(Anxiously) Woof ! Woof-woof!
Dialog_Action_990700005_103,"Dogmeat, go find help! Only you can get past them!"
Dialog_Action_990700005_104,(Bravely) Woof!
Dialog_Action_990700005_105,"We all are counting on you, Dogmeat!"
Dialog_Action_990700005_106,"(Dogmeat pricks up his ears, he seems to have heard something.)"
Dialog_Action_990700005_107,"Hello, little friend."
Dialog_Action_990700005_108,Woof!
Dialog_Action_990700005_109,Do you need help?
Dialog_Action_990700005_110,(Affirmatively) Woo-woof!
Dialog_Action_990700005_111,"Let's go then, good boy!"
Dialog_Action_990700006_101,"Another assassination mission. Even after the end of the world, people still find time to kill each other..."
Dialog_Action_990700006_102,"Sure enough, there are guards... but I brought some <color=#f0615dFF>lucky bullets. I can finish these poor saps without meeting them head-on.</color>"
Dialog_Action_990700006_103,"This guy looks like a badass, I should avoid fighting him if I can."
Dialog_Action_990700006_104,"Hell, it's a <color=#f0615dFF>trap</color>... There must be some items nearby that will help me pass through safely..."
Dialog_Action_990700006_105,Another successful mission...
Dialog_Action_990700006_106,"Being a mercenary is hungry work, but it still beats being a mayor..."
Dialog_Action_990700006_107,It's just... when will this end?
Dialog_Action_990700007_101,The mission is to hunt down a Deathclaw...
Dialog_Action_990700007_102,It doesn't seem like an easy job. Definitely got its fair share of mutant monsters.
Dialog_Action_990700007_103,"Damn it, why did I lie about my skill level? I can't kill a damn thing with just one shot... Oh, MacCready, look at you, you're in a real pickle!"
Dialog_Action_990700007_104,Freeze! Who are you?!
Dialog_Action_990700007_105,I could ask you the same question. What are you doing alone in such a dangerous place?
Dialog_Action_990700007_106,"A Deathclaw has been harassing the town for a while, so the townsfolks saved up some bottle caps and asked mercenaries to kill it..."
Dialog_Action_990700007_107,"If... If I kill this Deathclaw, the townsfolks can save their money!"
Dialog_Action_990700007_108,"So you just ran into a Deathclaw's lair to take it head on? Ma'am, with all due respect, what were you thinking?"
Dialog_Action_990700007_109,I...I...I can protect myself!
Dialog_Action_990700007_110,"Oh, come on. Stay close, I'll protect you."
Dialog_Action_990700007_111,...
Dialog_Action_990700007_112,"Look, that's the Deathclaw!"
Dialog_Action_990700007_113,Hush... Don't be stupid!
Dialog_Action_990700007_114,Stand behind me and stay silent. This beast is deadly.
Dialog_Action_990700007_115,Phew! It's finally over! Now our town is safe!
Dialog_Action_990700007_116,You are amazing! What brought you to this place? Are you an angel that heaven sent to help us?
Dialog_Action_990700007_117,I...I...
Dialog_Action_990700007_118,"(Crap. If I tell her that I'm one of the mercenaries hired by the townsfolk... Ugh, I don't want her to think badly of me...)"
Dialog_Action_990700007_119,"I'm a soldier, just passing through. You're safe, kiddo!"
Dialog_Action_990700007_120,"Call me Lucy! What about you? Brave soldier, what is your name?"
Dialog_Action_990700007_121,I... uh... name's Robert MacCready. Let's get out of here first!
Dialog_Action_990700008_101,Lucy! Lucy! Where are you?
Dialog_Action_990700008_102,"Damn, I really shouldn't have hidden in this subway station to pass the time... It's all my fault!"
Dialog_Action_990700008_103,I don't know what's ahead...I shouldn't have acted rashly before I knew the situation.
Dialog_Action_990700008_104,"Lucy, there you are!"
Dialog_Action_990700008_105,"Robert, stay back! There are a bunch of Ghouls here!"
Dialog_Action_990700008_106,Lucy!
Dialog_Action_990700008_107,"There's too many! Robert, take our son and run!"
Dialog_Action_990700008_108,No!
Dialog_Action_990700008_109,I... will always love... you... My brave... Ro...
Dialog_Action_990700008_110,NOOOOOOO!
Dialog_Action_990700008_111,(MacCready grits his teeth) I have to take Duncan away from here... I can't let Lucy die in vain!
Dialog_Action_990700008_112,At last...
Dialog_Action_990700008_113,I won't let Lucy die in vain.
Dialog_Action_990700008_114,"I want to be a real father, and raise Duncan right!"
Dialog_Action_990700009_101,Dad... I can't walk anymore...
Dialog_Action_990700009_102,"Hang in there, Duncan, I heard a renowned doctor lives here. As long as we can find him, he will heal you."
Dialog_Action_990700009_103,Cough...cough...
Dialog_Action_990700009_104,"Duncan, you stay here for a while. Dad'll be back real soon."
Dialog_Action_990700009_105,"It seems that this doctor's house was raided by bandits... We are outnumbered but, there are traps in the room. I need to figure out a way to thin their ranks..."
Dialog_Action_990700009_106,"Thank god, I've been trapped in this place for two days! Two more, and I'd probably have starved to death..."
Dialog_Action_990700009_107,"This is my son Duncan. He's stricken with a... strange disease. I've talked to a lot of doctors, but none of them can cure him."
Dialog_Action_990700009_108,You are Duncan's only hope. Help him!
Dialog_Action_990700009_109,"(Doctor examines Duncan carefully) I'm afraid I can't help your child, stranger. I have never seen this affliction before..."
Dialog_Action_990700009_110,What? What should I do?
Dialog_Action_990700009_111,"Don't worry, I heard that the Commonwealth Wasteland has the best doctors. Maybe you can find the help you need over there."
Dialog_Action_990700009_112,I... I can try my luck in the Commonwealth Wasteland but... Duncan won't make it that far.
Dialog_Action_990700009_113,"Don't worry, I will take care of Duncan until you come back from the Commonwealth Wasteland."
Dialog_Action_990700009_114,Thank you... Oh thank you...
Dialog_Action_990700010_101,Seems I'm a mercenary again. The Gunners who hired me don't seem to be upstanding people...
Dialog_Action_990700010_102,"Duncan wouldn't like me going back to my old job... but in order to save him, I can't worry about morals."
Dialog_Action_990700010_103,"The goal is to occupy an abandoned Vault... I have to be careful, the most terrifying thing in a place like this is often not the enemy, but the deadly machines themselves."
Dialog_Action_990700010_104,Wh... what are you going to do to us?
Dialog_Action_990700010_105,I... who are you? What are you doing in such a dangerous place?
Dialog_Action_990700010_106,"We're just scavengers, picking up the leftovers in this abandoned vault."
Dialog_Action_990700010_107,"You did a great job, MacCready. This vault is ours now."
Dialog_Action_990700010_108,Now let's get rid of these eyesores...
Dialog_Action_990700010_109,What? Are you really going to kill these unarmed people?
Dialog_Action_990700010_110,"This is the law of the Wasteland, friend. As a mercenary, you should understand this."
Dialog_Action_990700010_111,...
Dialog_Action_990700010_112,It's not just about the money for me anymore.
Dialog_Action_990700010_113,"Scavengers, run!"
Dialog_Action_990700010_114,"Thank you for your help... Good luck, friend."
Dialog_Action_990700010_115,"I'm still a mercenary, but I'm not what I used to be."
Dialog_Action_990700010_116,Now I have a reason to fight.
Dialog_Action_990700011_101,"Danse, Cutler, are you ready to start your training?"
Dialog_Action_990700011_102,"Yes, sir!"
Dialog_Action_990700011_103,"Good. But this time, I want you to fight on your own."
Dialog_Action_990700011_104,...
Dialog_Action_990700011_105,"Sorry, sir? Cutler and I have been fighting side by side since the day I joined the army, why..."
Dialog_Action_990700011_106,"The battlefield is always cruel and ever changing, Danse. Although your comrades will make you strong, you must also learn to complete missions by yourself on the battlefield. Understood?"
Dialog_Action_990700011_107,Understood! Sir!
Dialog_Action_990700011_108,Yes! Sir!
Dialog_Action_990700011_109,"Very good, so let's start with you first, Danse. Show me what you've got!"
Dialog_Action_990700011_110,"Great, Danse. I knew you wouldn't let me down."
Dialog_Action_990700011_111,That's my man.
Dialog_Action_990700011_112,"Sir, I still hope to work with Cutler in the future. I think our friendship enables us to overcome all sorts of difficulties!"
Dialog_Action_990700011_113,"I have high expectations for both of you and I hope that you can both become strong warriors in the future. That way when the mission requires you to fight alone, you can trust in your own abilities. Understood?"
Dialog_Action_990700011_114,Yes! Sir!
Dialog_Action_990700012_101,"Hey, Danse, I heard that after this mission, We will be reporting to the Prydwen!"
Dialog_Action_990700012_102,For real!? I have been looking forward to this for a long time. I can finally board that miraculous battleship.
Dialog_Action_990700012_103,"There, there. Let's clean out this beast den first. Say, how about a race?"
Dialog_Action_990700012_104,Sure. This time I will win.
Dialog_Action_990700012_105,"It looks like you won, Danse."
Dialog_Action_990700012_106,Told you I would win.
Dialog_Action_990700012_107,That's right. Drinks are on me this time! Well... we are going to be drinking on the Prydwen!
Dialog_Action_990700012_108,Hahaha! Well said!
Dialog_Action_990700013_101,"Alright, Danse. The mission Captain Kells assigned us is to clean out a Ghoul lair."
Dialog_Action_990700013_102,I have served on the Prydwen for a year. When will I get some real challenges?
Dialog_Action_990700013_103,Blame it on your bad luck. Your brother Cutler cleaned out the mutants' fortress this time. Maybe I can do it next time?
Dialog_Action_990700013_104,Haha! You serious?
Dialog_Action_990700013_105,"I'm a man of my word. Okay, let's cut to the chase. Let's split up and meet each other after the mission is complete."
Dialog_Action_990700013_106,That about does it.
Dialog_Action_990700013_107,"Sir, our mission is complete. Time to go home."
Dialog_Action_990700013_108,Danse... I just received some bad news...
Dialog_Action_990700013_109,What's wrong?
Dialog_Action_990700013_110,Cutler's reconnaissance team... was ambushed... communication was completely cut off...
Dialog_Action_990700013_111,...
Dialog_Action_990700013_112,The entire team was missing by the time the rescue team Kells got there...including your brother Cutler...
Dialog_Action_990700013_113,"No... that's impossible... sir! Permission to go to the area where Cutler went missing, I swear I'll get him back!"
Dialog_Action_990700013_114,"Not now, soldier. We are soldiers and obedience is what matters most. After returning to the Prydwen, I will make a request with the Captain."
Dialog_Action_990700014_101,"(Radio) Danse, come back. It's been three weeks and you need to rest."
Dialog_Action_990700014_102,"No, I want to keep looking. I have a hunch. I'm gonna find him."
Dialog_Action_990700014_103,There must be clues to Cutler's location in this mutants' lair.
Dialog_Action_990700014_104,"(Radio) If you insist on going deep into that lair, all you'll find... is pain."
Dialog_Action_990700014_105,(Danse turns off the communicator)
Dialog_Action_990700014_106,...
Dialog_Action_990700014_107,D-Danse...
Dialog_Action_990700014_108,No... impossible...
Dialog_Action_990700014_109,I'm feeling... angry... the pain...
Dialog_Action_990700014_110,K-Kill me...Or...I'll...kill you...
Dialog_Action_990700014_111,Cutler!!
Dialog_Action_990700014_112,It's over...
Dialog_Action_990700014_113,"Finally I get it. Mutants, Ghouls... these sad and twisted creatures are nothing but tumors on the Wasteland."
Dialog_Action_990700014_114,"They are like cancerous cells. If they are not completely removed, they will only cause more pain."
Dialog_Action_990700014_115,"In order to prevent them from causing more pain, I must... destroy them!"
Dialog_Action_990700015_101,"Helen, evacuate with Reese to a safe place, quick. Let me deal with these mutants!"
Dialog_Action_990700015_102,"There are too many of them, sir, this is too dangerous! I suggest we fight here until reinforcements arrive!"
Dialog_Action_990700015_103,"At this rate, we are resigning ourselves to death. I will figure out a way to get the reinforcements, you draw the attention of those Greenskins."
Dialog_Action_990700015_104,Take Reese with you and try to hold on until I come back!
Dialog_Action_990700015_105,"O... Okay, sir!"
Dialog_Action_990700015_106,Huff...huff...This should be it...
Dialog_Action_990700015_107,Why? Enemies again?
Dialog_Action_990700015_108,It seems...I'm going to die at the hands of these mutants... I hate it...
Dialog_Action_990700015_109,"I received a distress signal, status report?"
Dialog_Action_990700015_110,"(Danse breathes a sigh of relief, finally showing the hints of a smile)"
Dialog_Action_990700016_101,"Arthur, I know you are around. Show yourself."
Dialog_Action_990700016_102,"How did you get here, and why are you wearing such casual clothes?"
Dialog_Action_990700016_103,I... Paladin Glade said he would allow me to sneak along and see how Paladin truly fight... So...
Dialog_Action_990700016_104,"Curses, we'll get back to that later."
Dialog_Action_990700016_105,Sorry... Sister Sarah.
Dialog_Action_990700016_106,"Take it easy, Arthur. Now that you're here, you are welcome to learn."
Dialog_Action_990700016_107,Hide in a safe place and watch my moves carefully so you can learn how the Brotherhood fights.
Dialog_Action_990700016_108,"O-Okay, Sister Sarah."
Dialog_Action_990700016_109,"Learn well, Arthur."
Dialog_Action_990700016_110,"The first lesson of combat: <color=#f0615dFF> The strength of the Brotherhood lies in unity. When all the fighters of the Brotherhood are united, they can defeat those that could never be defeated alone</color>."
Dialog_Action_990700016_111,"Well... what a coincidence, Sarah."
Dialog_Action_990700016_112,"Glade, I know this is your doing, but we'll talk about that later. First, Arthur lay witness to the Brotherhood's might!"
Dialog_Action_990700016_113,Teehee... Sure thing!
Dialog_Action_990700016_114,"Corvin? You're involved in this matter, too?"
Dialog_Action_990700016_115,Uh...
Dialog_Action_990700016_116,We'll talk later. There are still Ghouls left. Let's go get them!
Dialog_Action_990700016_117,Yes!
Dialog_Action_990700016_118,"S-so awesome, Sister Sarah is the best."
Dialog_Action_990700016_119,"Arthur, always remember that everyone's power is limited, even a warrior like me."
Dialog_Action_990700016_120,"Having comrades-in-arms will make you truly strong and when the Brotherhood of Steel can unite, it will become a force that can change the entire Wasteland."
Dialog_Action_990700016_121,"(Arthur's face blushes) Okay, Sister Sarah."
Dialog_Action_990700017_101,"Darn, these Super Mutants broke our formation."
Dialog_Action_990700017_102,<color=#f0615dFF>I must regroup with my troops to defeat these Greenskins. </color>
Dialog_Action_990700017_103,"Tin Man, weak sauce! Super Mutants rule!"
Dialog_Action_990700017_104,Oh? Then let's find out!
Dialog_Action_990700017_105,How come!? How come!? Why isn't the Tin Man afraid of Super Mutants?!
Dialog_Action_990700017_106,"We may be outnumbered, but the warriors of the Brotherhood have iron wills and fight as one."
Dialog_Action_990700017_107,You will never be able to defeat the Brotherhood of Steel!
Dialog_Action_990700017_108,"Sir, your father wants you to return to the fortress immediately."
Dialog_Action_990700017_109,Did he say why? The remaining mutants here have not been cleaned up yet.
Dialog_Action_990700017_110,"He said to help you to perform better on missions, a special team will be assembled to assist you on your missions. You can choose the members of the team."
Dialog_Action_990700017_111,You will then be promoted to Iron Guard. You'll be the first soldier in the history of the Brotherhood to obtain this rank.
Dialog_Action_990700017_112,This is an incredible honor. But duty calls. The civilians here still need my help.
Dialog_Action_990700017_113,Let's talk after I clean up the rest of these mutants!
Dialog_Action_990700017_114,You... really are the pride of Elder Lyons.
Dialog_Action_990700018_101,"(Radio) Sarah, you don't have to do this. There are just too many mutants, you should run!"
Dialog_Action_990700018_102,"Don't be foolish Three Dog, you are the hope of the Capital Wastelanders and GNR Radio will not fall so easily."
Dialog_Action_990700018_103,(Radio) You don't have to risk your life for an old DJ like me.
Dialog_Action_990700018_104,Leave it to us. Just stay put and wait for us to recuse you!
Dialog_Action_990700018_105,"The battle here is over. Glade, let the brothers clean up the battlefield. We are moving on."
Dialog_Action_990700018_106,Yes!
Dialog_Action_990700018_107,"(Radio) Sarah, a large number of mutants have gathered in GNR Plaza, and there seems to be a... Mutant Megamon."
Dialog_Action_990700018_108,"Glade, we're going to play it safe. Assemble all of our men immediately. We must safeguard the GNR Square! Invincible!"
Dialog_Action_990700018_109,Invincible!
Dialog_Action_990700019_101,"Sir, our scout has just sent word that the Enclave is launching an attack on the Jefferson Monument. The Water Purification Project has failed!"
Dialog_Action_990700019_102,"James sacrificed himself in order to stop the Enclave, while Madison evacuated the survivors."
Dialog_Action_990700019_103,What?!?
Dialog_Action_990700019_104,(Sarah is silent for a some time).
Dialog_Action_990700019_105,We must act now to save Madison and the Water Purification Project survivors!
Dialog_Action_990700019_106,There should be a lot of Enclave troops in the underground passages. Only by routing the Enclave can the survivors evacuate safely.
Dialog_Action_990700019_107,Sarah Lyons... Thank God.
Dialog_Action_990700019_108,"Brothers, call the medical team. The survivors need treatment!"
Dialog_Action_990700019_109,Yes!
Dialog_Action_990700019_110,"It's all over, the Water Purification Project has failed again..."
Dialog_Action_990700019_111,"No. As long as you're alive, there is still hope. I will tell my father what happened here. The Enclave's crimes are too numerous. They must pay."
Dialog_Action_990700020_101,"Warriors of Lyons Pride! We have fought many bloody battles all for this moment! The Enclave has set up defenses, but our will is stronger."
Dialog_Action_990700020_102,"It's time for the Enclave to pay their dues! Brothers, let's go! Invincible!"
Dialog_Action_990700020_103,Invincible!!
Dialog_Action_990700020_104,The Jefferson Monument is ours.
Dialog_Action_990700020_105,"There may be some Enclave members remaining in the Water Purification Project reactor, but they are no longer a threat."
Dialog_Action_990700020_106,"Next, I will accompany James' son to the reactor. No matter what happens there, I will accept my destiny."
Dialog_Action_990700020_107,For the hope of a better tomorrow! For the Capital Wasteland! Invincible!
Dialog_Action_990700020_108,Invincible!
Dialog_Action_990700021_101,Super Mutants... You won't threaten the Capital Wasteland any longer.
Dialog_Action_990700021_102,Hah! Humans! The Super Mutants in the Capital Wasteland have united under my leadership!
Dialog_Action_990700021_103,Challenge me if you dare! Human cub.
Dialog_Action_990700021_104,"This seems to be the leader of the mutants. Defeat him, and all the mutants of the Capital Wasteland will fall!"
Dialog_Action_990700021_105,"It seems Shepard has fled, but he won't get away so easily."
Dialog_Action_990700021_106,Only by defeating him can I earn the respect of the Brotherhood.
Dialog_Action_990700022_101,"You actually caught up, pipsqueak."
Dialog_Action_990700022_102,"Yeah, and today it's you or me. No half measures."
Dialog_Action_990700022_103,Hah! Hah! Hah! Come at me if you've got the guts. I'll be waiting!
Dialog_Action_990700022_104,Just you wait!
Dialog_Action_990700022_105,Cough...cough...impossible...
Dialog_Action_990700022_106,Nothing is impossible.
Dialog_Action_990700022_107,"You want to unite your brothers. This is a bold plan. Unfortunately, the Brotherhood cannot let you do this."
Dialog_Action_990700022_108,"The Brotherhood won't tolerate monsters like you, so curse the FEV virus with your dying breath."
Dialog_Action_990700022_109,Cough...cough...
Dialog_Action_990700022_110,"Arthur, why did you come here alone... did you kill the leader of the mutants?"
Dialog_Action_990700022_111,Yes.
Dialog_Action_990700022_112,That's incredible...
Dialog_Action_990700022_113,"It's no surprise, the Brotherhood is invincible."
Dialog_Action_990700023_101,You possess the courage to enter alone.
Dialog_Action_990700023_102,I'm not here to fight. May I have a word with your leader?
Dialog_Action_990700023_103,First you have to prove that you are qualified.
Dialog_Action_990700023_104,"This underground passage is full of Ghouls. If you can clear the passage, our leader will meet with you."
Dialog_Action_990700023_105,Can we talk now?
Dialog_Action_990700023_106,You have proven your strength. What is it you desire?
Dialog_Action_990700023_107,The Brotherhood must reunite under the same banner. We need the exiles to return to the Brotherhood!
Dialog_Action_990700023_108,"Hah! As long as that weak Elder Lyons is still alive, we will never reach a consensus."
Dialog_Action_990700023_109,"Elder Lyons is no longer there. As much as I respect him, what the Brotherhood needs more is power. And you should join us, join the common goals of the Brotherhood."
Dialog_Action_990700023_110,...what?
Dialog_Action_990700023_111,We... will consider it.
Dialog_Action_990700024_101,"Elder Maxson, why are you here...?"
Dialog_Action_990700024_102,"At ease, Knight. I want to see the Synths of the Institute with my own eyes."
Dialog_Action_990700024_103,"Elder, I'm afraid I can't allow you to run into danger! This is our duty!"
Dialog_Action_990700024_104,"Don't worry, a battle-hardened warrior like myself won't be defeated so easily."
Dialog_Action_990700024_105,"By knowing yourself and the enemy you can survive any battle. As an Elder, I must understand the true strength of the Institute to take them down."
Dialog_Action_990700024_106,Yes! Elder!
Dialog_Action_990700024_107,"Elder, are you all right?"
Dialog_Action_990700024_108,"Rest assured, it's no big deal."
Dialog_Action_990700024_109,"But, these Institute Synths are starting to make me worry. The Brotherhood is well aware of the consequences of abusing technology. If the Institute is allowed to continue like this, sooner or later these scientists will get what's coming to them."
Dialog_Action_990700025_101,Warriors of the Brotherhood.
Dialog_Action_990700025_102,We are here because the Commonwealth Wasteland has a malignant tumor. The cancer known as the Institute.
Dialog_Action_990700025_103,"The Brotherhood is committed to protecting technology from being abused, whereas the Institute and the Synths are the wretched result of that very abuse."
Dialog_Action_990700025_104,"In order for mankind to have a safer tomorrow, the cancer...must be eradicated!"
Dialog_Action_990700025_105,Yes! Elder!
Dialog_Action_990700025_106,The Institute's influence here has been purified.
Dialog_Action_990700025_107,"However, the true Institute is still hidden underground!"
Dialog_Action_990700025_108,We must be united to truly uproot this disease.
Dialog_Action_990700025_109,Invincible! My men!
Dialog_Action_990700025_110,Invincible!
Dialog_Action_990700026_101,"I have ordered Captain Mayburn to investigate my father's death on numerous occasions, but he just toys with me."
Dialog_Action_990700026_102,"Something's off about this guy. Since no one else wants to find out, I'll do it myself."
Dialog_Action_990700026_103,"I found some <color=#f0615dFF>Stealth Boys</color> in my father's ammo chest, and they're finally coming in handy!"
Dialog_Action_990700026_104,"If I can <color=#f0615dFF>sneak past these guards</color>, I'll be able to approach Captain Mayburn's office without anyone seeing."
Dialog_Action_990700026_105,I think I heard something in Captain Mayburn's room... Let's see what's going on.
Dialog_Action_990700026_106,"So, is it done?"
Dialog_Action_990700026_107,"Of course, all of the men who knew have been... taken care of."
Dialog_Action_990700026_108,"Good. According to the plan, on the evening of the new moon, you're gonna open the town gate. We'll graciously offer you 10% of the spoils."
Dialog_Action_990700026_109,I want 20%.
Dialog_Action_990700026_110,"Don't push your luck. Know your place, we could easily destroy your town instead."
Dialog_Action_990700026_111,O-Okay...
Dialog_Action_990700026_112,My god... So it was Captain Mayburn who murdered my father!
Dialog_Action_990700026_113,Now what? Who would believe me?
Dialog_Action_990700026_114,"Right. If I put this secret into leaflets, and post them on the wall of every household, someone will surely notice!"
Dialog_Action_990700026_115,The truth cannot be buried!
Dialog_Action_990700027_101,"The townspeople are ready to fight, but the Raiders have us vastly outnumbered."
Dialog_Action_990700027_102,If I could sneak into the Raider's camp and start a fire...
Dialog_Action_990700027_103,This looks like a good place.
Dialog_Action_990700027_104,(Lights a fire)
Dialog_Action_990700027_105,"Whoa hey, where did this fire come from!?"
Dialog_Action_990700027_106,Put it out! Put it out!
Dialog_Action_990700027_107,"Excellent, time to make my escape!"
Dialog_Action_990700028_101,"Good grief, I thought this was a shortcut..."
Dialog_Action_990700028_102,It seems I'll have to get through this monster-filled cave to reach Diamond City.
Dialog_Action_990700028_103,"There's a deathclaw in the way, and it looks like that there's no other route. I have to kill it."
Dialog_Action_990700028_104,I should fully prepare myself. This is not a game.
Dialog_Action_990700028_105,"Little girl, how did you get into this tunnel? Do you have a death wish?"
Dialog_Action_990700028_106,What are you talking about? This girl's totally wiped out.
Dialog_Action_990700028_107,"Don't worry, kid, you're safe now."
Dialog_Action_990700028_108,Is this... Diamond City?
Dialog_Action_990700028_109,"Well of course we're in Diamond City! Come with us, we'll protect you."
Dialog_Action_990700029_101,I thought the Bunker Hill water source was polluted because the Dwellers accidentally broke a nuclear waste barrel. I never would've expected that the Children of Atom were behind it...
Dialog_Action_990700029_102,This is getting more and more interesting. I have to find a way to investigate further.
Dialog_Action_990700029_103,Freeze! You're not one of us! What are you doing here?
Dialog_Action_990700029_104,"Confess, or the power of the Atom will devour the liar!"
Dialog_Action_990700029_105,Um... um... I'm here to join you! YES! Eh!? Show me the path to fission!!
Dialog_Action_990700029_106,...
Dialog_Action_990700029_107,"How fortuitous, you too are inspired by the Atom. Welcome, sister. We have been preaching to the Dwellers of Bunker Hill, I believe they will join us soon."
Dialog_Action_990700029_108,"Don't interfere with our sacred work, sister."
Dialog_Action_990700029_109,So close! It seems I have to find a way to get out of here.
Dialog_Action_990700029_110,I think I've finally lost those annoying disciples.
Dialog_Action_990700029_111,I have to tell the Bunker Hill guards about this. They should know how to deal with the cultists.
Dialog_Action_990700029_112,"Of course, this will be front-page material for ""Publick Occurrences!” Haha!"
Dialog_Action_990700030_101,I have a long-held suspicion that the mayor is a Synth. I'm sure I'll find some evidence this time.
Dialog_Action_990700030_102,"I didn't expect this place to be so well guarded though, how am I supposed to sneak through all this?"
Dialog_Action_990700030_103,I heard something... Seems the mayor may show himself.
Dialog_Action_990700030_104,"M7-62, your report is late again."
Dialog_Action_990700030_105,(Softly) Be quiet! You have to address me as Mr. Mayor...
Dialog_Action_990700030_106,"Your report is late again... ""Mr. Mayor.”"
Dialog_Action_990700030_107,What should I do? This girl from a newspaper has been following me nonstop lately. I'm in danger!
Dialog_Action_990700030_108,Can the Institute find a way to get me out? I don't want to be mayor anymore... It's just too much pressure!
Dialog_Action_990700030_109,"I will report to my superiors. In the meantime, you will continue to play the role of Diamond City Mayor."
Dialog_Action_990700030_110,Damn it! These Coursers really are cold-hearted.
Dialog_Action_990700030_111,Just as I thought...
Dialog_Action_990700030_112,"This is big news. The Mayor of Diamond City is a Synth, and he's colluding with the Institute!"
Dialog_Action_990700030_113,This'll make the front page for sure!
Dialog_Action_990700031_101,"L-Leave me alone... Dima, save yourself!"
Dialog_Action_990700031_102,"My brother, I won't let you suffer through this experiment again."
Dialog_Action_990700031_103,"Once we escape, we will get away from grasp of the Institute. We'll be free."
Dialog_Action_990700031_104,"I will stall the Institute, you find a way to <color=#f0615dFF>use your detective talents</color> to get us out of here!"
Dialog_Action_990700031_105,"I... actually, I'm just an empty shell. I only contain Nick Valentine's memories... But I will try my best!"
Dialog_Action_990700031_106,This doesn't feel right. I should be able to find some important items in this room that can help us escape.
Dialog_Action_990700031_107,"As expected, this key looks very important."
Dialog_Action_990700031_108,It seems that I really do have some detective talent... Don't think too much now... it's escape that matters the most.
Dialog_Action_990700031_109,"Finally, we are free! Now, it's about Dima... Ah... my head hurts..."
Dialog_Action_990700031_110,Ahhh...
Dialog_Action_990700031_111,"Nick! Nick, are you alright!? The Institute won't come here. We are safe!"
Dialog_Action_990700031_112,...
Dialog_Action_990700031_113,Who are you? Ahhh... you look like... a mechanical monster! Stay away from me! Stay away from me!
Dialog_Action_990700031_114,"Nick, what's the matter with you? I'm your brother, Dima!"
Dialog_Action_990700031_115,What kind of terrible monster is this?! This robot can talk! Ahhh!
Dialog_Action_990700031_116,"I'm sorry, brother. It seems that your memory data is scrambled."
Dialog_Action_990700031_117,Looks like I have to leave you behind and move on... Alone.
Dialog_Action_990700031_118,I hope you have a safe journey.
Dialog_Action_990700032_101,I've been following these gangsters for some time. They look sneaky. Must be up to something.
Dialog_Action_990700032_102,"This should be their lair, maybe I can sneak in and throw a wrench into their plans."
Dialog_Action_990700032_103,"Stop, who's there!? Eh... a robot..."
Dialog_Action_990700032_104,Follow me and meet the boss!
Dialog_Action_990700032_105,"Okay, after you."
Dialog_Action_990700032_106,What's the matter with this robot? Aren't we waiting for the mayor to get his daughter?
Dialog_Action_990700032_107,"Boss, maybe this robot is the mayor's messenger?"
Dialog_Action_990700032_108,No kidding. Get rid of this guy!
Dialog_Action_990700032_109,"Don't move, or I will blow myself up!"
Dialog_Action_990700032_110,Hahahahaha! What are you talking about?
Dialog_Action_990700032_111,Activating the Self-Destruct Protocol... beep... beep...
Dialog_Action_990700032_112,"Boss, it looks like he is going to explode!"
Dialog_Action_990700032_113,Beep... beep... beep...
Dialog_Action_990700032_114,Run!
Dialog_Action_990700032_115,"Ahhhhh, help!"
Dialog_Action_990700032_116,"Ha, I didn't expect that would be so easy to scare them away. Now let's see what they're up to."
Dialog_Action_990700032_117,Uncle... You don't seem to be in league with these guys. Are you here to save me?
Dialog_Action_990700032_118,"Hey kid, what are you doing here?"
Dialog_Action_990700032_119,"The bad guys disguised themselves as traveling merchants, and said they would give me sweets.. then... then they brought me here, and said they wanted to use me to get a ransom from my dad..."
Dialog_Action_990700032_120,"I just heard talk of a ransom... Is your father Henry Roberts, the mayor of Diamond City?"
Dialog_Action_990700032_121,"Yes...Sir, can you get me out of here?"
Dialog_Action_990700032_122,"Of course, you... you're not afraid of me?"
Dialog_Action_990700032_123,"Certainly not, I can see that you have a kind heart, sir."
Dialog_Action_990700033_101,The citizens said they saw the mysterious guest in this very courtyard.
Dialog_Action_990700033_102,There are a lot of mutant creatures here. I must act carefully.
Dialog_Action_990700033_103,This place has been cleaned up and there is still no trace of the mysterious guest.
Dialog_Action_990700033_104,Where must he be hiding?
Dialog_Action_990700033_105,Freeze! Don't you run!
Dialog_Action_990700033_106,"Damn, he disappeared again."
Dialog_Action_990700033_107,What's the story with this guy...
Dialog_Action_990700034_101,"Stay here, Synth! Hehehe, I wonder how your boss is going to deal with you."
Dialog_Action_990700034_102,Dyno... right? You should worry more about yourself. I heard that your boss learned about your cheating at cards.
Dialog_Action_990700034_103,How do you know... I... I'm going to talk to the boss about it...
Dialog_Action_990700034_104,"Nick... Valentine, right? You are a bit more ""mechanical"" than I thought..."
Dialog_Action_990700034_105,"You don't look like a local, so how did you know my name?"
Dialog_Action_990700034_106,"Your assistant thought you were in trouble and asked me to help you, so I came. Are you ready to get out of this place?"
Dialog_Action_990700034_107,Of course.
Dialog_Action_990700034_108,"Okay, I'll lure them away. And you find a way to get out."
Dialog_Action_990700034_109,Finally free of this place.
Dialog_Action_990700034_110,"I have a feeling you have a favor to ask of me. Since you saved my life, go ahead, tell me about the mess you're in."
Dialog_Action_990700034_111,"Hmm... this is embarrassing. I'm an old popsicle, been frozen for 200 years."
Dialog_Action_990700034_112,I came to ask you to help find my missing son...
Dialog_Action_990700035_101,"Nate, I have to say, this island is really weird."
Dialog_Action_990700035_102,Hah! Do Synths think it's weird too?
Dialog_Action_990700035_103,"Even for me, a Synth, the dense fog here is very strange. Plus those babbling Atom Cultists..."
Dialog_Action_990700035_104,Nate?
Dialog_Action_990700035_105,Nate?!
Dialog_Action_990700035_106,"Damn, I hope those Children of Atom freaks didn't nab him..."
Dialog_Action_990700035_107,Nate? Nate?!
Dialog_Action_990700035_108,"I'm here, don't worry Nick. I live a hard life."
Dialog_Action_990700035_109,"I met a Synth who reminds me of you, he helped me avoid those crazy Children of Atom."
Dialog_Action_990700035_110,Similar to me...? You mean...
Dialog_Action_990700035_111,"Hello, Nick."
Dialog_Action_990700035_112,You are...
Dialog_Action_990700035_113,"My name is Dima, and you're my brother."
Dialog_Action_990700035_114,My... brother? What nonsense are you talking about? I do not have even a single memory of you.
Dialog_Action_990700035_115,"Nick, listen to me. Although you don't remember me, I am indeed your brother. As long as you are willing to listen, I can explain about... our past."
Dialog_Action_990700035_116,Hmm... Maybe I should leave you be for a while.
Dialog_Action_990700035_117,But... aren't you still anxious to find your son?
Dialog_Action_990700035_118,"Please... I've been waiting for 200 years, what can a few more minutes hurt?"
Dialog_Action_990700036_101,"Father, why are you here?"
Dialog_Action_990700036_102,"Kellogg, I want to see the surface world with my own eyes."
Dialog_Action_990700036_103,"The surface is too dangerous for you, you'd better head back now."
Dialog_Action_990700036_104,"Don't worry, I can <color=#f0615dFF> summon a Synth to resist any enemy's attack in the nick of time. </color>"
Dialog_Action_990700036_105,(Kellogg is silent for a while)
Dialog_Action_990700036_106,"Yes, Father."
Dialog_Action_990700036_107,"Kellogg, I don't think you like to see me."
Dialog_Action_990700036_108,Huh? Why?
Dialog_Action_990700036_109,"Since I became Father, in order to redefine human beings, I've tried to understand this so-called... ""kinship."" As far as I know, you're the only person close to me."
Dialog_Action_990700036_110,"After all, when I was young, it was you brought me into the Institute's ranks."
Dialog_Action_990700036_111,"We haven't seen each other for a long, long time, Father. The Institute pays, so I work for them. Nothing more."
Dialog_Action_990700036_112,Okay.
Dialog_Action_990700037_101,Father? Why are you here again?
Dialog_Action_990700037_102,"Kellogg, I want to know more about your past. I thought it would be better to ask you directly."
Dialog_Action_990700037_103,"Father, I'm on a mission. You of all people should know that my missions are very dangerous."
Dialog_Action_990700037_104,Don't worry about it.
Dialog_Action_990700037_105,Now can we calm down and have a good chat?
Dialog_Action_990700037_106,"Sorry, Father. I don't think we should discuss this... and you may not like the answers you find."
Dialog_Action_990700037_107,"I thought that life in the Institute would make one indifferent, but your indifference is beyond my imagination."
Dialog_Action_990700037_108,What is it that makes you this way?
Dialog_Action_990700037_109,(Kellogg leaves without a word)
Dialog_Action_990700038_101,"Father, I think our actions this time... are non-compliant."
Dialog_Action_990700038_102,"I have to figure out why, despite being the highest authority in the Institute, I cannot access Kellogg's files."
Dialog_Action_990700038_103,Maybe... I mean maybe... the former Institute board members... don't want you to know something?
Dialog_Action_990700038_104,"Which makes me want to figure it out even more. There should be unencrypted backups in the secret archives here. If I can look at those files, I might be able to figure out more."
Dialog_Action_990700038_105,But a forceful break-in may cause the system to identify us as intruders...
Dialog_Action_990700038_106,Do you think I care?
Dialog_Action_990700038_107,"Yes, Father."
Dialog_Action_990700038_108,I checked the terminal and found Kellogg's files.
Dialog_Action_990700038_109,"The sample, ""Shaun,"" has been extracted from Vault 111..."
Dialog_Action_990700038_110,"The target's mother became emotional during the mission, so agent Kellogg ""eliminated"" the obstacle to ensure that the sample could be extracted smoothly..."
Dialog_Action_990700038_111,"The DNA samples from subject ""Shaun"" will be extracted for third-generation Synths, and ""Shaun"" will be trained in the Institute as a reserve."
Dialog_Action_990700038_112,"The board agreed that Kellogg's actions toward Shaun's mother may affect the health of Shaun's sample at the Institute, so this file has been classified."
Dialog_Action_990700038_113,So this is what Kellogg wouldn't tell me.
Dialog_Action_990700038_114,... I need... some time to absorb this.
Dialog_Action_990700039_101,"Father, I don't think it's a good idea to go into the sewer. You could get an infection... all kinds of germs..."
Dialog_Action_990700039_102,"Don't worry about this, Kellogg used to take me here when I was a kid."
Dialog_Action_990700039_103,"Kellogg likes to hide his supplies in these hard to get to places, so we will just have to take some risks."
Dialog_Action_990700039_104,This is... You Are Special... I remember Kellogg said this was left to me by my father.
Dialog_Action_990700039_105,...
Dialog_Action_990700039_106,"X6-88, give me some time to put the pieces together."
Dialog_Action_990700039_107,"Yes, Father."
Dialog_Action_990700040_101,Kellogg's on a mission to eliminate Railroad agents and exiled Synths.
Dialog_Action_990700040_102,We were teleported near the mission area. Should we wait for Kellogg to complete the mission before we look for him?
Dialog_Action_990700040_103,"No, I just want to take a closer look at the damage the exiled Synths caused."
Dialog_Action_990700040_104,Yes.
Dialog_Action_990700040_105,Father... you shouldn't have come all the way here.
Dialog_Action_990700040_106,"Kellogg, I already know what happened between you and my parents."
Dialog_Action_990700040_107,...
Dialog_Action_990700040_108,"So, what does this mean? You are now the head of the Institute. Bet you want to order your Synths to kill me."
Dialog_Action_990700040_109,"Kellogg, you should know that I am not the kind of person who longs for revenge."
Dialog_Action_990700040_110,"It is strange to say, but I have no memory of my parents. It is difficult for me to anguish over their suffering."
Dialog_Action_990700040_111,But you have deprived me of the right to have a family. Perhaps because of this I will never be able to forgive you.
Dialog_Action_990700040_112,I have never longed for forgiveness.
Dialog_Action_990700040_113,But I am also the director of the Institute... You are the most important field agent the institute has. I understand your value to us.
Dialog_Action_990700040_114,"What's more, you are my only bond to the past...."
Dialog_Action_990700040_115,"Life... is always so complicated. If the Institute wants to ""redefine human beings,"" then maybe the Institute has to figure out the complexities of the human condition first."
Dialog_Action_990700040_116,Or throw away these meaningless shackles.
Dialog_Action_990700040_117,"Kellogg, I won't forgive you, but that does not mean I have to destroy you. I will continue to let you act in the field as an agent of the Institute."
Dialog_Action_990700040_118,"As for the issues between us, I think I will let another, more... suitable person handle this matter. Maybe... I can also learn something from him."
Dialog_Action_990700040_119,"Fair enough, I will wait."
Dialog_Action_990700041_101,"Madison, why are you still here? The super mutants managed to get in, we need to evacuate!"
Dialog_Action_990700041_102,"The Brotherhood promised to support us, where are they now?"
Dialog_Action_990700041_103,They're out there fighting the mutants.
Dialog_Action_990700041_104,"James, you get our men out of here first. Your wife is nine months pregnant, she needs you."
Dialog_Action_990700041_105,What about you?
Dialog_Action_990700041_106,"I'm going to find the Brotherhood soldiers. <color=#f0615dFF>Maybe I'll have a better chance of surviving with them</color>, maybe I can even save some precious experimental data."
Dialog_Action_990700041_107,"No, this is too dangerous!"
Dialog_Action_990700041_108,"No time to think about it! Go now, James!"
Dialog_Action_990700041_109,Okay... Good luck.
Dialog_Action_990700041_110,It should be safe here...
Dialog_Action_990700041_111,Madison... This is hard for me to say... but I am afraid this will be the last time we can provide support for the Purification Operation.
Dialog_Action_990700041_112,What?
Dialog_Action_990700041_113,"We... just received an order from Elder Lyons. Because of the division within the Brotherhood, we will be recalled to the fort to fill those vacancies."
Dialog_Action_990700041_114,But... the Water Purification Project... This is for the benefit of humanity! We're so close...
Dialog_Action_990700041_115,"I will report it to Elder Lyons, but... you'd better prepare for the worst."
Dialog_Action_990700041_116,"Madison, I have orders to protect you. The Super Mutants have broken through our defenses, we must evacuate as soon as possible."
Dialog_Action_990700041_117,I'm counting on you!
Dialog_Action_990700041_118,Madison... Where's James?
Dialog_Action_990700041_119,"He got out already, don't worry."
Dialog_Action_990700041_120,"Well, stay behind me and I'll ensure your safety."
Dialog_Action_990700042_101,M-Madison?
Dialog_Action_990700042_102,"What's wrong? I'm very busy, so you'd better hurry up."
Dialog_Action_990700042_103,"Something happened in the underground facility. We sent some people to investigate, but its been a long time, and we've lost communications."
Dialog_Action_990700042_104,"So you want me to help? I'm a scientist, not a mercenary."
Dialog_Action_990700042_105,Then... forget it...
Dialog_Action_990700042_106,"Hey, don't worry. I'll go down and take a look."
Dialog_Action_990700042_107,I think this is where the problem lies. It seems that someone's trying to sneak into Rivet City from the underground tunnel. They must have accidently stirred up those creatures...
Dialog_Action_990700042_108,"It was me. I tried to sneak into Rivet City. Hi, Madison, it's been a while."
Dialog_Action_990700042_109,James! You bastard!
Dialog_Action_990700042_110,"(Madison steps forward, giving James a hard slap)"
Dialog_Action_990700042_111,"Okay, maybe I deserved that."
Dialog_Action_990700042_112,"Tell me, why have you suddenly come back after all this time?"
Dialog_Action_990700042_113,I came back to fulfill our dream... the Water Purification Project.
Dialog_Action_990700043_101,(Radio) Madison! Madison! Get a grip!
Dialog_Action_990700043_102,"Sarah? It's over, the Enclave are everywhere... And James sacrificed himself... We failed..."
Dialog_Action_990700043_103,"Get a grip! Gather the survivors, Lyons Pride will rendezvous with you as soon as possible!"
Dialog_Action_990700043_104,Lyons... Thank God.
Dialog_Action_990700043_105,"Brothers, call the medical team. The survivors need treatment!"
Dialog_Action_990700043_106,Yes!
Dialog_Action_990700043_107,"It's all over, the Water Purification Project has failed again..."
Dialog_Action_990700043_108,"No. As long as you're alive, there is still hope. I will tell my father what happened here. The Enclave's crimes are too numerous, it's time for them to pay."
Dialog_Action_990700044_101,We've finally arrived in the Commonwealth Wasteland. I agreed to meet Dr. Zimmer here... Maybe they've already arrived.
Dialog_Action_990700044_102,But there seems to be a lot of Feral Ghouls here. I have to be careful not to be torn to pieces.
Dialog_Action_990700044_103,"Ah, welcome to the Commonwealth Wasteland, Madison. We have been waiting for you for a long time."
Dialog_Action_990700044_104,"Dr. Zimmer, the Institute will guarantee my safety, right?"
Dialog_Action_990700044_105,Naturally. Having you here is a great honor for the Institute and we will do our best to ensure your safety.
Dialog_Action_990700044_106,"That can be saved for later. We have to leave this place, the ghouls seem to be in a rage."
Dialog_Action_990700044_107,"As agreed, Madison, we will escort you to the Institute. We will provide you with the best team and all the scientific resources you could ever want. Working with Father, you will redefine..."
Dialog_Action_990700044_108,Thanks.
Dialog_Action_990700044_109,...
Dialog_Action_990700044_110,"Very cynical... just as rumored. Maybe you will become good friends with Father, who knows?"
Dialog_Action_990700045_101,"Madison, if you take such risks to help me, the Institute will begin to suspect you."
Dialog_Action_990700045_102,"I only do what's right, Virgil. You are right. The Institute's FEV virus research must be stopped."
Dialog_Action_990700045_103,Okay then...
Dialog_Action_990700045_104,"This hospital has the materials I need to make the serum, but the security system here is not so easy to breach."
Dialog_Action_990700045_105,"Don't worry, I have deployed several Synth Guards. They will help us with the security issue."
Dialog_Action_990700045_106,"By all means then, lead the way."
Dialog_Action_990700045_107,I need some time to prepare my serum...
Dialog_Action_990700045_108,"... It's time. If I lose my mind because of this, you must kill me immediately, Madison."
Dialog_Action_990700045_109,I believe in you.
Dialog_Action_990700045_110,(Virgil nods and injects himself with the serum)
Dialog_Action_990700045_111,"It seems that the serum worked, my mind hasn't been affected by the virus!"
Dialog_Action_990700045_112,"Goodbye then, Madison. I will hide within the Glowing Sea and concentrate on the FEV antidote."
Dialog_Action_990700045_113,"Goodbye, Virgil, and godspeed."
Dialog_Action_990700046_101,Lil' Guy stay here. You belong in pot.
Dialog_Action_990700046_102,"God, am I going to die here like this? That may be the dumbest way to commit suicide."
Dialog_Action_990700046_103,Hah! Hah! Lil' Guy recite Macbeth when going down in pot. Beautiful!
Dialog_Action_990700046_104,Good Guy Rex go with Strong. Strong go with Good Guy.
Dialog_Action_990700046_105,Strong! B-but why?
Dialog_Action_990700046_106,"Strong help Good Guy, and Good Guy find milk of human kindness for Strong! Strong will become stronger!"
Dialog_Action_990700046_107,Ummm... let's get out of here first!
Dialog_Action_990700046_108,Portal... Which one!?
Dialog_Action_990700046_109,What? This is your portal? Don't you even know how to use your own portal?
Dialog_Action_990700046_110,"Teleport... oh, dear! Strong hate it!"
Dialog_Action_990700046_111,"Okay... Let me see... Look, it says:"
Dialog_Action_990700046_112,"<color=#f0615dFF> ""Exit Portal, looks different from others! Other portals look the same. Detour! ""</color>"
Dialog_Action_990700046_113,"It seems that <color=#f0615dFF> only one portal can lead directly to the exit</color>, Strong, think about it! Which one to pick?"
Dialog_Action_990700046_114,YES! Strong hates thinking!
Dialog_Action_990700046_115,"Strong, are you sure this is the exit..."
Dialog_Action_990700046_116,Strong guess!
Dialog_Action_990700046_117,Strong! Why you running around with Lil' Guy!?
Dialog_Action_990700046_118,(Whispers) Tell them you are going to take Lil' Guy to the pot.
Dialog_Action_990700046_119,"Strong help Good Guy Rex, and Good Guy find Strong milk! Milk of human kindness!"
Dialog_Action_990700046_120,(Lets out an imperceptible wail)
Dialog_Action_990700046_121,YES! Hah! Hah! Hah! Hah!
Dialog_Action_990700046_122,Strong Crazy! Lock him up with Lil' Guy!
Dialog_Action_990700047_101,When will Good Guy find Strong milk?
Dialog_Action_990700047_102,"It's ""milk of human kindness""... Hey... Weren't we locked in here? I'm using this radio to send a distress call. Hopefully it won't be long before someone comes to our rescue."
Dialog_Action_990700047_103,Hah! It won't. Super Mutants know Good Guy Rex is using radio.
Dialog_Action_990700047_104,"What did you say? M-my distress call, do those mutants know about it?"
Dialog_Action_990700047_105,"Super Mutants wait for someone to save Good Guy, then capture and eat them up!"
Dialog_Action_990700047_106,My God... then... no one will come to save us?
Dialog_Action_990700047_107,Hello!
Dialog_Action_990700047_108,A human! How did you get in?
Dialog_Action_990700047_109,"When I heard the distress signal, I barged in. Do you need help?"
Dialog_Action_990700047_110,The Lil' Blue Guy look weak. Strong doesn't need Lil' Blue Guy!
Dialog_Action_990700047_111,Of course! Of course we need help! Can you help us out?
Dialog_Action_990700047_112,"Easy peasy. I'll take out the mutant boss, and you find a way out."
Dialog_Action_990700047_113,A portal again! Strong has headache!
Dialog_Action_990700047_114,"Let me see... <color=#f0615dFF> ""Exit Portal, looks different from the others! Other portals look the same. Detour! ""</color>...This is exactly the same as the previous sign!"
Dialog_Action_990700047_115,"Strong, think again. <color=#f0615dFF> How did we leave last time? </color>"
Dialog_Action_990700047_116,Strong hate thinking!!!
Dialog_Action_990700047_117,"Ah, glad to see that you have found a way out."
Dialog_Action_990700047_118,(Panting) Huff... hfff...Akh...you don't say... are we safe now?
Dialog_Action_990700047_119,"Of course, I have already taken out the boss."
Dialog_Action_990700047_120,Lil' Blue Guy... amazing! Strong like him!
Dialog_Action_990700047_121,"You look like a Vault Dweller, and you can take care of yourself... I have a favor to ask of you."
Dialog_Action_990700047_122,Oh?
Dialog_Action_990700047_123,"(Softly) Did you see this big man? Name Strong. Since I read him Macbeth, he has been requesting that I find him ""milk of human kindness""."
Dialog_Action_990700047_124,Uh... there's no such thing...
Dialog_Action_990700047_125,"(Softly) I know, I know. I mean, you look like someone who can go anywhere. Can you just take him, keep him busy? Maybe he will forget about it in a few days."
Dialog_Action_990700047_126,Uh... I... guess?
Dialog_Action_990700047_127,"Strong, do you want to look for milk with this Lil' Blue Guy?"
Dialog_Action_990700047_128,"Strong does! But... isn't Good Guy Rex coming, too?"
Dialog_Action_990700047_129,"Don't worry, Strong. I'll give you this book, Macbeth, it can help you find milk!"
Dialog_Action_990700047_130,Good Guy Rex is!
Dialog_Action_990700047_131,"(Whispers) Hey, it feels like a pathetic life form..."
Dialog_Action_990700048_101,Why Brahmins? It beats Strong. Are they smarter with two heads?
Dialog_Action_990700048_102,"Strong, listen to me, these ""Brahmins"" have treasures with them. Of course they include..."
Dialog_Action_990700048_103,The milk.
Dialog_Action_990700048_104,The milk!? Strong want milk!
Dialog_Action_990700048_105,"Then find the right path, Strong. There are many portals in this cave. Only by finding the right one can we find those Brahmins faster."
Dialog_Action_990700048_106,Portals?!? Strong hate portals!!!
Dialog_Action_990700048_107,"Uh, the recording. Strong want to listen."
Dialog_Action_990700048_108,(Recording) <color=#f0615dFF>Deep and long is the cave path.</color>
Dialog_Action_990700048_109,(Recording) <color=#f0615dFF>Remember the portal spell! </color>
Dialog_Action_990700048_110,"(Recording) <color=#f0615dFF>The raging flames hide the crossroads,</color>"
Dialog_Action_990700048_111,(Recording) <color=#f0615dFF>The Uranium dust is the light. </color>
Dialog_Action_990700048_112,What does it mean!? Strong not understand!
Dialog_Action_990700048_113,"Aha, it looks like you've found the Brahmins. Congratulations, Strong."
Dialog_Action_990700048_114,Strong want milk!
Dialog_Action_990700048_115,Those Brahmins should have the milk you want.
Dialog_Action_990700048_116,How do you feel?
Dialog_Action_990700048_117,Strong feel... stronger!
Dialog_Action_990700048_118,Umm... alright! As long as you are happy.
Dialog_Action_990700049_101,"Strong... I want to reiterate that Dogmeat is my friend, not just a pet."
Dialog_Action_990700049_102,"Strong want dog friend, too!"
Dialog_Action_990700049_103,"Okay... Okay... You're the boss. I remember there's a dog breeder near here, as long as we can go through these portals..."
Dialog_Action_990700049_104,No-no-no-no-no!!
Dialog_Action_990700049_105,... We can find that dog breeder. Maybe you can find a dog friend you like.
Dialog_Action_990700049_106,Okay... Strong take portal...
Dialog_Action_990700049_107,"The recording, Strong want to listen."
Dialog_Action_990700049_108,"(Recording) Aha, finally found the portal hub. Now my grumpy brothers won't bother me."
Dialog_Action_990700049_109,"(Recording) Next, I just need to tweek the portals a little bit..."
Dialog_Action_990700049_110,(Recording) This <color=#f0615dFF>workshop</color> looks good. I can hide the correct portal here...
Dialog_Action_990700049_111,"(Recording) So many rooms here, makes me dizzy..."
Dialog_Action_990700049_112,(Recording) Where should I hide the correct portal? Right... just like that...
Dialog_Action_990700049_113,"(Recording) I just have to remember the spell: <color=#f0615dFF>""Factory and Hospital""</color>... Heehee, perfect."
Dialog_Action_990700049_114,"(Recording) Aha, there are some smoke machines here, great!"
Dialog_Action_990700049_115,(Recording) How am I supposed to hide my precious portal...Um...
Dialog_Action_990700049_116,(Recording) There. Both rooms have what they hate the most: <color=#f0615dFF>books</color>. They'd never want to touch the portals hidden here...ha! Hahaha!
Dialog_Action_990700049_117,Another Super Mutant? How did you find this place?
Dialog_Action_990700049_118,Strong take the portal. This and that!
Dialog_Action_990700049_119,"Erickson, old pal, come meet Strong. He's very similar to you. Not the kind of Super Mutant that wants to beat a man to a pulp at first sight."
Dialog_Action_990700049_120,Oh... alright. What do you want?
Dialog_Action_990700049_121,Strong want dog friend!
Dialog_Action_990700049_122,A dog friend? You are such a funny guy.
Dialog_Action_990700049_123,(Erickson blows his whistle)
Dialog_Action_990700049_124,"This is my newly trained hound, she can be your friend."
Dialog_Action_990700049_125,"Strong has dog friend. Strong happy. You are Strong's friend, too!"
Dialog_Action_990700049_126,The Lil' Blue Guy find Strong a dog friend. Strong is happy. Lil' Blue Guy friend!
Dialog_Action_990700049_127,"Aha, being happy is what matters most."
Dialog_Action_990700050_101,"Strong, we are going to raid an underground Enclave base this time."
Dialog_Action_990700050_102,En Grave?
Dialog_Action_990700050_103,"Yeah, the Enclave are a bunch of big bad guys, always cooking up conspiracies from their underground base."
Dialog_Action_990700050_104,Strong hate conspiracies! Strong take out the En Grave!
Dialog_Action_990700050_105,"That's the spirit! But be careful, they have a lot of portals here, don't get lost, Strong!"
Dialog_Action_990700050_106,Um...Strong not afraid! Strong took portals many times!
Dialog_Action_990700050_107,"We are counting on you, Strong!"
Dialog_Action_990700050_108,"The recording, Strong want to listen."
Dialog_Action_990700050_109,"(Recording) Great, the smoke machine has been activated. With this, we can ambush the intruders and catch them off guard."
Dialog_Action_990700050_110,(Recording) Now let me check on the soldiers' posts...
Dialog_Action_990700050_111,"<color=#f0615dFF>(Recording) Jeff! Where is Jeff!? Damn it, you're guarding the portal to the floor C2! Don't think you can slip away due to the smoke machine. I'll crush you if I catch you...</color>"
Dialog_Action_990700050_112,"(Recording) Damn, Jeff's nowhere to be found."
Dialog_Action_990700050_113,<color=#f0615dFF>(Recording) Put this Sentry Bot near the portal on floor C3! </color>
Dialog_Action_990700050_114,(Recording) Huff. Huff. Now that idiot sergeant will never find me.
Dialog_Action_990700050_115,(Recording) I thought that joining the Enclave would benefit intelligent people like me. Didn't expect these guys to be a bunch of idiots. I have to find a way to escape...
Dialog_Action_990700050_116,"(Recording) The portal to floor C4. These idiots <color=#f0615dFF>added an extra security door</color>, but they left the key in plain sight... Oh my god, is there anyone dumber than them in this world?"
Dialog_Action_990700050_117,"How fast. Strong, I bet the Enclave would never have thought you could break through their defenses so easily. Now the information we need is in their library."
Dialog_Action_990700050_118,"En Grave, weak! Strong, amazing!!"
Dialog_Action_990700050_119,"By the way, I received a report saying that the Enclave has a soldier who wants to defect. His name is... Jeff? Have you seen him, Strong?"
Dialog_Action_990700050_120,No! But the recording says Jeff has run away!
Dialog_Action_990700050_121,"Well, maybe one day, we'll meet this Jeff in the Wasteland."
Dialog_Action_800107701_101,"Seraphim, you crossed the line. I know that you took Father and gave his power to that human being. Now you want that human to destroy our lineage that's survived for thousands of years?"
Dialog_Action_800107701_102,You have deviated from the path of the Maykrs. Your blind arrogance keeps you from seeing your degradation. Thousands of worlds are destroyed by your selfish desires...
Dialog_Action_800107701_103,"I did this to reinvigorate my clan! Without Argent Energy, Urdak would cease to exist!"
Dialog_Action_800107701_104,No. You did this to prolong your life.
Dialog_Action_800107701_105,...
Dialog_Action_800107701_106,"For the last time, where are you hiding Father?"
Dialog_Action_800107701_107,It's you!!
Dialog_Action_800107701_108,No time for introductions. Khan Maykr is using Argent Energy to resurrect the Icon of Sin and we must stop her now.
Dialog_Action_800107701_109,(Doom Slayer makes a muffled snort)
Dialog_Action_800107701_110,So how should we stop her?
Dialog_Action_800107701_111,I found out that two Maykr Starships are charging Khan's flagship.
Dialog_Action_800107701_112,"We are on one of those starships. VEGA, I need the Doom Slayer to connect you to Urdak's central system so you can disrupt the energy supply."
Dialog_Action_800107701_113,Understood.
Dialog_Action_800107701_114,"Now, connect VEGA to the central system."
Dialog_Action_800107701_115,Taking control of the systems... I saw... Dr. Hayden... Am I... Father...?
Dialog_Action_800107701_116,We still need to control the other starship. Khan Maykr will try to stop us.
Dialog_Action_800107701_117,(Doom Slayer makes a nonchalant grunt)
Dialog_Action_800107707_101,You don't know what you are doing!
Dialog_Action_800107707_102,An avatar of Khan. She is invincible until we defeat all of her avatars.
Dialog_Action_800107707_103,So what are we waiting for?
Dialog_Action_800107707_104,"Wonderful. The energy supply to this starship has been cut off, too."
Dialog_Action_800107707_105,Detected... huge Argent Energy response... from the flagship...
Dialog_Action_800107707_106,"You are too late. I have resurrected the Icon of Sin. He will purify your world, just as predicted."
Dialog_Action_800107707_107,We must rush to Khan's flagship immediately. Only there can we open the portal to Earth!
Dialog_Action_800107707_108,"Quickly! The longer the Icon of Sin stays on Earth, the stronger his power will be!"
Dialog_Action_800107711_101,You mortals dare to interfere with the lineage of the Maykrs that has stood for thousands of years?!?
Dialog_Action_800107711_102,You... ruined Urdak...
Dialog_Action_800107711_103,The... lineage... thousands of years...
Dialog_Action_800107711_104,We must go...
Dialog_Action_800107711_105,"VEGA will try and activate the portal to Earth. Remember, the longer the Icon of Sin stays on Earth, the stronger his power will be!"
Dialog_Action_800107712_101,"Hold on... what are you doing? The Earth is at stake, and now you are looking for a... rabbit?"
Dialog_Action_800107712_102,(Doom Slayer nods)
Dialog_Action_800107712_103,Alright... can you hurry up?
Dialog_Action_800108310_101,"... As predicted, the two Titans finally meet."
Dialog_Action_800108310_102,"I have upgraded your super weapons, and they will now recharge over time during battle."
Dialog_Action_800108310_103,"The armor of the Icon of Sin allows him to resist impacts from the Crucible and BFG. Whenever the demon is summoned, he will enter a Weakened state during which the Bloody Saw can cause massive damage to the Icon himself."
Dialog_Action_800108310_104,"It's time to go, this planet... no, this universe depends on you!"
Dialog_Action_800108310_105,"As predicted... you will be the savior of mankind. Your power is their shield, and your will is their sword..."
Dialog_Action_800108310_106,"You will never be defeated, because you can fight for an eternity!"
Dialog_Action_800108310_107,(Looks at the Icon of Sin falling from the sky)
Dialog_Action_800108310_108,It's over. The Earth is safe! What do you plan to do next? Find a place to go on vacation?
Dialog_Action_800108310_109,"(Doom Slayer says nothing, clutches his gun, and walks away)"
Dialog_Action_800108310_110,(Shakes head) Right. Your battle is eternal. You will never stop fighting.
Dialog_Action_800108600_101,"Hey, who are you people? Are you here for the treasure too?"
Dialog_Action_800108600_102,"It seems like ones we were expecting have finally arrived. Now, please hand over the treasure map, or lead us straight to the loot."
Dialog_Action_800108600_103,Your not getting anything from us. Run!
Dialog_Action_800108600_104,"So you let them get away, just like that?"
Dialog_Action_800108600_105,"Overseer, we've got work to do."
Dialog_Action_800108601_101,"What treasures do you think the Crimson Caravan buried here? The Gunners are here, too. It doesn't seem like it will be just junk."
Dialog_Action_800108601_102,Who cares!? We'll take whatever it is!
Dialog_Action_800108601_103,"Now, now. Let's clean up this room first. This is the place where that guy with the treasure map appeared. Lets see if we can find where he has gone!"
Dialog_Action_800108601_104,Hah! Check this out. There is a mark on this map. That should be it!
Dialog_Action_800108601_105,Excuse me? Can you show us that map?
Dialog_Action_800108601_106,"Unexpectedly, the Raiders have found traces of the treasure map."
Dialog_Action_800108601_107,"It's rare that they can think for themselves, and I am surprised when they are even the slightest bit clever."
Dialog_Action_800108601_108,"Makes two of us. We've got to be careful, things might get hairy once we find the treasure."
Dialog_Action_800108605_101,There. This is where the map marker indicated.
Dialog_Action_800108605_102,I think a lot of folks have come here before. How could they find the treasure maps secret so easily?
Dialog_Action_800108605_103,Don't overthink this. We might not get anything if we don't hurry up and get in there.
Dialog_Action_800108605_104,Come out! I know you're in there! The treasure map must be in there with you!
Dialog_Action_800108605_105,(Cracking) There is a sound of a crowbar violently trying to pry open the door.
Dialog_Action_800108605_106,It seems that a survivor needs our help!
Dialog_Action_800108605_107,"It's safe outside, come on out."
Dialog_Action_800108605_108,"Thank you, thank you! Judging from your outfit... are you the Minutemen?"
Dialog_Action_800108605_109,"Yes, I didn't expect that someone would recognize us. What are you doing here? Looking for the treasure map?"
Dialog_Action_800108605_110,"Now, I know I can trust you. Truthfully... I made it up. There was no treasure map. Actually, I am the treasure map, and the only person who knows about the treasure."
Dialog_Action_800108611_101,"Is the ""garbage"" in those cases the treasure? Don't treat us like fools! Hurry up and hand over the real treasure!"
Dialog_Action_800108611_102,Don't waste your breath! We'll find out after we take them out!
Dialog_Action_800108611_103,It looks like we have been set up! Now what?
Dialog_Action_800108611_104,"Well, raise your gun and fight!"
Dialog_Action_800108611_105,(Looks at the treasure map) The treasure?
Dialog_Action_800108611_106,"(Looks at the storage boxes in the cases) They aren't worth a dime, but they are indeed treasures to someone, right?"
Dialog_Action_800108611_107,"(Downcast) Yeah, these are the treasures."
Dialog_Action_800108611_108,Tell me more.
Dialog_Action_800108611_109,"So, our team back then was not the Crimson Caravan, we were just a bunch of destitute refugees who fled from the Capital Wasteland."
Dialog_Action_800108611_110,"Then why did you come to Quincy? Since you were not the Crimson Caravan, why did you use the name?"
Dialog_Action_800108611_111,"Hearing that the Boston Wasteland is a better place, we decided to use the name the Crimson Caravan to intimidate any potential threats. It's just that we didn't expect to safely escape from the Capital, only to be attacked in Boston Wasteland. Only a few of us survived."
Dialog_Action_800108611_112,"What are those ""treasures""?"
Dialog_Action_800108611_113,Those are...
Dialog_Action_800108611_114,"In a way, we did find treasure. They are indeed rare in the Wasteland."
Dialog_Action_990700051_101,"Guys, the pre-sale data from Manta Man is not good. The boss will definitely give us an earful. Do you have any ideas?"
Dialog_Action_990700051_102,We can launch a reboot event. A restart of Manta Man by himself. We can improve the quality of the artwork.
Dialog_Action_990700051_103,"We've used this idea like 20 times... talk about beating a dead horse... Fine, what is the name of this solo Manta Man project?"
Dialog_Action_990700051_104,"How about ""Journey to the Abyss!”"
Dialog_Action_990700051_105,"Doesn't sound very new... but let's run the story, shall we?"
Dialog_Action_990700051_106,"Okay, then let's start with Manta Man's hometown, Deepsea Kingdom..."
Dialog_Action_990700051_107,Hang on. Hang on. Is there a problem with the setting? Does Manta Man need oxygen? Didn't he come from the bottom of the sea?
Dialog_Action_990700051_108,Uh... because... he's cursed?
Dialog_Action_990700051_109,That just doesn't make sense.
Dialog_Action_990700051_110,"Well, our hero's story shouldn't just be about laughs, right? There must be some mages, curses, meteors, or something to keep Manta Man from being overpowered."
Dialog_Action_990700051_111,"...Well, let's get back to that later. So how do we break this curse?"
Dialog_Action_990700051_112,Manta Man consumes oxygen like a normal human when he explores. He can find oxygen tanks to replenish his oxygen levels.
Dialog_Action_990700051_113,"Wait, how can he find oxygen tanks in the Deepsea Kingdom? ... Never mind... Forget it..."
Dialog_Action_990700051_114,"With that... Manta Man is one step closer to his real enemy. Will he finally be rid of the despicable curse? Stay tuned for the second episode of Journey to the Abyss, and the holiday special."
Dialog_Action_990700051_115,What? Holiday special?
Dialog_Action_990700051_116,"We have sponsors, you know."
Dialog_Action_990700052_101,"Alright, let's talk about the holiday special..."
Dialog_Action_990700052_102,"The holiday special. So soon? ""Journey to the Abyss"" is just about to get interesting."
Dialog_Action_990700052_103,"Sponsors want to know... We got... you know, the famous Nuka-Cola..."
Dialog_Action_990700052_104,"...Stop beating around the bush, what is the holiday special about?"
Dialog_Action_990700052_105,"The plot of the holiday special is less involved. Nuka-Girl's space shuttle falls into the Deepsea Kingdom, and Manta Man rescues Nuka-Girl from the Deepsea monsters. Classic. How does that sound?"
Dialog_Action_990700052_106,"YES! Someone help, these terrifying sea creatures are tearing me apart, and my Thirst Zapper can't shoot underwater! Who can come save me!?"
Dialog_Action_990700052_107,"Nuka-Girl, don't panic! Manta Man is here!"
Dialog_Action_990700052_108,Uh...! These monsters are strong. I'm going to lose!
Dialog_Action_990700052_109,"Manta Man, drink the Nuka-Cola I prepared for you! It will rejuvenate you!"
Dialog_Action_990700052_110,YES! That's refreshing. Take that! Monsters!
Dialog_Action_990700052_111,Is this the dialogue you want? Too cliché...
Dialog_Action_990700052_112,"The head of the sponsor's sales department wrote it. None of my business. I just think it's cheesy, and frankly unrealistic..."
Dialog_Action_990700052_113,But?
Dialog_Action_990700052_114,"(Whispers) He gave us a bunch of money, and stock in the company..."
Dialog_Action_990700052_115,(Softly) Really? Then I'll just turn a blind eye...
Dialog_Action_990700053_101,"Okay, now let's get back to the main story of ""Journey to the Abyss""... The second series will show how Manta Man finally finds the source of the curse."
Dialog_Action_990700053_102,Looks like there will be a super villain.
Dialog_Action_990700053_103,"You don't say. There must be a powerful villain who will bring out Manta Man's strength and valor, right? Just wait and see!"
Dialog_Action_990700053_104,Akh... Kah... this curse. I can't breathe! Who is the vicious scoundrel that has humiliated and cursed me so I can't breathe underwater!?
Dialog_Action_990700053_105,"Hehehehe... my dear brother, isn't it painfully ironic? This is your punishment for always fighting with the Unstoppable League and leaving the sea with no protector!"
Dialog_Action_990700053_106,What? Isn't it a reboot? How come the villain is still the Abyssal Overlord? Can you make a new villain? Someone new and mysterious?
Dialog_Action_990700053_107,I don't think you have grasped what reboot means... We redo the story with the same hero and villain. This couldn't be safer and it maximizes engagement through nostalgia!
Dialog_Action_990700053_108,Wouldn't readers find it strange? Like why that villain again?
Dialog_Action_990700053_109,Don't worry. We can give the villain a new reason to hate our hero. Last time he was manipulated by Dr. Brainwash. This time we present this as an evil version from a Parallel Universe!
Dialog_Action_990700054_101,I just got the pre-sale data from last month. Guess how many copies of Journey to the Abyss our Boston division sold?
Dialog_Action_990700054_102,"I guess it's not as good as our flagship product, Grognak, but I'm going to guess 50 copies, at least ."
Dialog_Action_990700054_103,"Just 2 copies! 2! That sucks! My phone is blowing up, it's the boss!"
Dialog_Action_990700054_104,Chill. Chill... What did he say?
Dialog_Action_990700054_105,He said to create a new and intriguing villain.
Dialog_Action_990700054_106,No worries. I'm prepared. Let's start with a sudden change to the Deepsea environment...
Dialog_Action_990700054_107,I hear the Deepsea creatures crying! An evil is polluting the Deepsea!
Dialog_Action_990700054_108,The surroundings have been exposed to radiation. I must find a way to fight this foul energy!
Dialog_Action_990700054_109,"Finally a sense of crisis, and it seems that this will be a truly powerful villain."
Dialog_Action_990700054_110,"At last, with this serum, I can eliminate the radiation monsters that are polluting in one fell swoop!"
Dialog_Action_990700054_111,"How does that sound? Not bad, huh? While being cursed, Manta Man has to deal with the monsters that pollute his ocean home. You see, our comics are related to environmental protection."
Dialog_Action_990700054_112,"Yes, this is a diverse world, and we cannot ignore the demands of those environmentalists."
Dialog_Action_990700055_101,It's time to unveil the new villain!
Dialog_Action_990700055_102,"Naturally, but we still have to have a little foreplay. Manta Man has to pass through this misty, Deepsea Maze before finally meeting the villain."
Dialog_Action_990700055_103,Deepsea? Misty? What are you talking about...
Dialog_Action_990700055_104,Things always add up... That's... the ink of the Mutant Squid! Yeah. No mistake...
Dialog_Action_990700055_105,It's finally time to unveil the new villain!
Dialog_Action_990700055_106,Kinda sweating here!
Dialog_Action_990700055_107,"No introducing... the legendary... ""Shrimpon!”! So? Isn't it super threatening!?"
Dialog_Action_990700055_108,...
Dialog_Action_990700055_109,"Shoot, Boss is calling! I have a bad feeling about this."
Dialog_Action_990700055_110,(Phone) I gave you a whole month to create a better villain. Guess what I just saw?
Dialog_Action_990700055_111,(Phone) Shrimpon?!? Are you playing with me or overusing Mentats?
Dialog_Action_990700055_112,But Boss...
Dialog_Action_990700055_113,(Phone) You are fired!
Dialog_Action_990700055_114,...
Dialog_Action_990700055_115,"Well, what should we do now?"
Dialog_Action_990700055_116,"""Manta Man defeated the Shrimpon easily. THE END."""
Dialog_Action_990700056_101,"Brother Peter, just as promised, the Beta version of ""Grognak and the Red Grotto"" is complete. Impressive, huh? Do you want to give it go?"
Dialog_Action_990700056_102,Of course! I can't wait.
Dialog_Action_990700056_103,Alright... what am I going to do in this game?
Dialog_Action_990700056_104,"I have already skipped the boring farming part for you. What you need to do is to control Grognak and lead your team to defeat one powerful leader after another. Then, challenge the Unstoppable League's sworn enemy: Dr. Brainwash!"
Dialog_Action_990700056_105,Hmm...I actually like farming. But I'll do it your way. Let's look at the boss battle!
Dialog_Action_990700056_106,"Your first opponent is a Forest Bear. It will try to heal its wounds when injured. But Grognak has the help of a powerful female martial artist, and she can stun the Forest Bear when it tries to heal!"
Dialog_Action_990700056_107,Umm... alright!
Dialog_Action_990700057_101,"I know this guy, the classic villain ""Grelok"" in the Grognak Series. Well done. Impressive."
Dialog_Action_990700057_102,Thank you for the compliment. We respect the consistency of our IPs.
Dialog_Action_990700057_103,So how should we deal with Grelok?
Dialog_Action_990700057_104,"It's very powerful, it will summon a horde of poisonous scorpions to attack you. And if someone in your team is killed, Grelok will go into a frenzy!"
Dialog_Action_990700057_105,"But don't worry, Grognak has the help of a female mecha warrior from the future. Her ""Thin Man"" bomb can easily tackle the scorpions!"
Dialog_Action_990700057_106,Why are Grognak's teammates all female?
Dialog_Action_990700057_107,"The consistency of IPs, remember!? The story of Grognak always has a heroic theme!"
Dialog_Action_990700058_101,The next boss is the Executioner Robot that appeared in the early Grognak Series. Its guillotine attack is very dangerous.
Dialog_Action_990700058_102,"When the Executioner Robot performs a guillotine strike, you can deal massive damage to interrupt its attack."
Dialog_Action_990700058_103,"Grognak's good friends, Inspector and Mistress of Mystery, are here to help!"
Dialog_Action_990700058_104,"Mistress of Mystery's Crush can inflict tons of damage to the Executioner Robot, and Inspector's Time Twist can boost your attack for a short time."
Dialog_Action_990700058_105,"Interesting, it looks like a very challenging battle."
Dialog_Action_990700059_101,"Look, this time Grognak and his friends are going against the Assault Stalker, a ruthless robot."
Dialog_Action_990700059_102,"Wait... Isn't this game called ""Grognak and the Red Grotto?” Why are there so many robots?"
Dialog_Action_990700059_103,They... they are the minions of Dr. Brainwash!
Dialog_Action_990700059_104,"Hmm...eh, isn't she Nuka-Girl? Where's this going?"
Dialog_Action_990700059_105,The game always needs crossovers. Nuka-Cola Corporation purchased some heavy product placement...
Dialog_Action_990700059_106,Okay... If you say so... How should we deal with the Assault Stalker?
Dialog_Action_990700059_107,"The Assault Stalker will release a Glandular Bomb, and the damage inflicted by the explosion is proportional to your current AP. At the same time, it will also summon a Self-Destruct Automaton, which must be terminated as soon as possible."
Dialog_Action_990700059_108,It doesn't sound too difficult.
Dialog_Action_990700060_101,Finally it's the sworn enemy of the Unstoppable League: Dr. Brainwash! This guy is a hard nut to crack!
Dialog_Action_990700060_102,"Yes, such a powerful boss. Aren't there supposed to be some animations or something so Dr. Brainwash can deliver his evil monologue?"
Dialog_Action_990700060_103,...About that...Umm... (whispers) we haven't done the story yet...
Dialog_Action_990700060_104,What?
Dialog_Action_990700060_105,"As I said, it's just a Beta version. Easy peasy. And who cares about the story nowadays?"
Dialog_Action_990700060_106,I do!
Dialog_Action_990700060_107,... Let's talk about how to deal with Dr. Brainwash! Dr. Brainwash will select and brainwash a certain class on your team.
Dialog_Action_990700060_108,"If you don't cast the skills of this particular class by the time the brainwash is complete, Dr. Brainwash will inflict a ton of damage and debuffs to your characters."
Dialog_Action_990700060_109,Sounds like a difficult guy to deal with.
Dialog_Action_990700060_110,That why he is the sworn enemy of the Unstoppable League!
Dialog_Action_990700060_111,"Well, that's it for the demonstration of ""Grognak and the Red Grotto.” Brother Peter, what do you say?"
Dialog_Action_990700060_112,Can we tighten up the graphics on level 3?
Dialog_Action_990700060_113,Absolutely.
Dialog_Action_990700061_101,"Scribe's Diary, No. NR-490SS, Oct. 2."
Dialog_Action_990700061_102,(With a long sigh)
Dialog_Action_990700061_103,"Proctor Quinlan really is a ""genius.” I told him I needed some biological samples to study radiation resistance. In response to my request, he actually sent an investigation team to collect samples..."
Dialog_Action_990700061_104,"I suspect that he's upset about the last time I secretly fed Emmet... Forget it, it will boost the experience somewhat."
Dialog_Action_990700061_105,"I hope I can find those ""biological samples"" quickly... Of course I have to find my investigators too, lest they run around on their own."
Dialog_Action_990700061_106,Quickly! Grab that mole. My detection instrument shows that the gamma rays it radiates has far exceeded the lethal amount. This guy is of great significance to our research!
Dialog_Action_990700061_107,"Oops, it ran away!"
Dialog_Action_990700061_108,"Damn! Fortunately, I managed to record its radiation traits. After it!"
Dialog_Action_990700062_101,Bah... the damn mole went into the sewer. Not sure what else I could have expected.
Dialog_Action_990700062_102,"I have to find my investigators first, maybe they have already caught the mole."
Dialog_Action_990700062_103,"Look, it's the mole!"
Dialog_Action_990700062_104,Approach it carefully and don't scare it away.
Dialog_Action_990700062_105,Neriah? Scribe Neriah?
Dialog_Action_990700062_106,Damn it! You scared it away!
Dialog_Action_990700062_107,Uh... Is this a bad time?
Dialog_Action_990700062_108,"(With a long sigh) So, what's the matter?"
Dialog_Action_990700062_109,Elder Maxson needs you to prepare a new batch of the X-111 compound. It is very urgent.
Dialog_Action_990700062_110,Alright. Alright.
Dialog_Action_990700063_101,I didn't expect that little mole to be such a pain in the neck.
Dialog_Action_990700063_102,"(Radio) Neriah, Neriah?"
Dialog_Action_990700063_103,"What's the matter, Superintendent?"
Dialog_Action_990700063_104,"(Radio) I heard that there's a limited-edition copy of ""Grognak the Barbarian"" where your working. If you have time, can you find it for me?"
Dialog_Action_990700063_105,(Sighs) Okay.
Dialog_Action_990700063_106,"You can't run now, little guy."
Dialog_Action_990700063_107,Senior Scribe! We found...
Dialog_Action_990700063_108,"What is it!? Damn, you scared away the mole I was looking for, again!"
Dialog_Action_990700063_109,"Uh... sorry... umm... we found this book, ""Grognak the Barbarian,"" on the other side of the building. I think you might want this."
Dialog_Action_990700063_110,"(Holds forehead with hand) Alright. Get me through to Proctor Quinlan, please."
Dialog_Action_990700063_111,"(Radio) Neriah, what have you got?"
Dialog_Action_990700063_112,"(Disinterested) The limited-edition copy, ""Grognak the Barbarian,” you asked for. Should I send it to you now?"
Dialog_Action_990700063_113,(Radio) Really? That's great. I'll buy you dessert tonight!
Dialog_Action_990700063_114,"(Disinterested) Ah, thank you so much!"
Dialog_Action_990700064_101,"We've spent too much time trying to catch this mole, we must get it this time!"
Dialog_Action_990700064_102,"Okay, lads, you know what to do. Split up and look for the mole."
Dialog_Action_990700064_103,"You have nowhere to run now, little guy..."
Dialog_Action_990700064_104,"My boy, what is this!"
Dialog_Action_990700064_105,"Fire, fire!"
Dialog_Action_990700064_106,Why!? Why are so many weird things happening? I just want to catch a mole!
Dialog_Action_990700064_107,"Fortunately, this big mole holds some research value...but I have to catch that little mole!"
Dialog_Action_990700065_101,"Ah, finally..."
Dialog_Action_990700065_102,"Strange though, why was it so easy to capture it this time?"
Dialog_Action_990700065_103,"Senior Scribe, now we have caught this guy, what are you going to do? Start the experiment as soon as we get back on the boat?"
Dialog_Action_990700065_104,"...How do I put it, since he was so difficult to catch, I've grown rather fond of this little guy..."
Dialog_Action_990700065_105,"There are a lot of biological samples in the Wasteland, but I think this little guy should be raised as a pet."
Dialog_Action_990700065_106,"At least it can scare Proctor Quinlan's cat, can't it? Hahaha."
Dialog_Action_990700066_101,"Doctor, what's the mission for?"
Dialog_Action_990700066_102,"Gosh, didn't you listen during the mission briefing? We came to this secret facility called ""Switchboard"" to find a strategic mechanical unit called P.A.M."
Dialog_Action_990700066_103,What is P.A.M.?
Dialog_Action_990700066_104,Geez! You really do space out! Predictive Analytical Machine or P.A.M. for short. It features powerful intelligence analysis and strategic deployment capabilities. Anything else you wanna know?
Dialog_Action_990700066_105,(Cries) You don't have to be so mean!
Dialog_Action_990700066_106,"Great, in order to complete the mission, I have to get these agents back..."
Dialog_Action_990700066_107,This is... this Assault Robot is P.A.M. A worthwhile trip indeed.
Dialog_Action_990700066_108,Detected signs of human life. Unit ready to start... Self-check initiated... Error: The unit has lost its main strategic goal ... Error...
Dialog_Action_990700066_109,"Seems like she's can't do anything since the world she was part of was destroyed almost two hundred years ago. After we find a technical expert to reprogram her, she can play her role again."
Dialog_Action_990700067_101,"Very good, our technical expert has reprogrammed P.A.M.. Let's see whether this P.A.M. is still capable of intelligent analysis."
Dialog_Action_990700067_102,Detected Institute's Synth combat unit. Recommendation: Careful disposal.
Dialog_Action_990700067_103,Agent: Stanley Carrington. Recommended target: find the lost Railroad agent. Success rate: 45%...
Dialog_Action_990700067_104,Why is the success rate so low?
Dialog_Action_990700067_105,Agent: Stanley Carrington. Personality defect detected: irritable. Recommendation: Refrain from emotions.
Dialog_Action_990700067_106,"Damn that robot, I'll show her how great I am!"
Dialog_Action_990700067_107,"Let's take a look, is the rate still only 45%?"
Dialog_Action_990700067_108,A fluke does not represent probability. Unit detected that Carrington is getting too emotional for another agency mission.
Dialog_Action_990700067_109,Nonsense.
Dialog_Action_990700068_101,"Warning. Detected the intrusion of ""Switchboard"" by Institute Synths. Recommendation: Evacuate all."
Dialog_Action_990700068_102,"What? Damn, I still have work to do!"
Dialog_Action_990700068_103,Agent: Stanley Carrington. Detected a large number of Institute Synths are being cleared. The clock is ticking. Every second of delay will reduce the chance of survival.
Dialog_Action_990700068_104,...
Dialog_Action_990700068_105,"Alright, but I have to rescue the agents first."
Dialog_Action_990700068_106,Detected a clear path ahead. Estimated chance of survival...76%. Warning. Agent: Desdemona missing... Estimated chance of survival... unknown...
Dialog_Action_990700068_107,Damn it! Damn it!
Dialog_Action_990700068_108,I must find Des quickly!
Dialog_Action_990700069_101,"(Radio) Agent: Carrington, please be calm. Getting too emotional will affect the success rate of the mission."
Dialog_Action_990700069_102,(Carrington grumbles)
Dialog_Action_990700069_103,"(Radio) According to the route the retreating Railroad agents used to get out of the ""Switchboard,"" this should be Agent Desdemona's hideout."
Dialog_Action_990700069_104,(Radio) There are still a large number of Institute Synths searching nearby. Recommendation: Find Desdemona as soon as possible.
Dialog_Action_990700069_105,Des! Are you alright!?!
Dialog_Action_990700069_106,"Stanley, relax, I'm fine."
Dialog_Action_990700069_107,"It's all my fault. I didn't have good information, and was caught off guard by the Institute's Synths."
Dialog_Action_990700069_108,Many died when they surrounded us... all because I couldn't keep my cool.
Dialog_Action_990700069_109,"It's okay, Stanley. As long as there is still a Railroad, we can rebuild. First thing we should do is find a new base."
Dialog_Action_990700070_101,"I think the Old North Church nearby could serve as an great new HQ for the Railroad. But before that, the nearby enemies should be cleaned up."
Dialog_Action_990700070_102,Leave it to me.
Dialog_Action_990700070_103,Detected Agent Stanley Carrington is in a state of anxiety and irritability. Not recommended to perform any missions in this state.
Dialog_Action_990700070_104,"Damn robot. I said leave it to me! As a robot, shouldn't you believe in humans?"
Dialog_Action_990700070_105,My primary task is to analyze and predict. Believing in humans does not conform to the logic of my behavior.
Dialog_Action_990700070_106,(Mumbles)
Dialog_Action_990700070_107,Mission accomplished. Concluded Agent Stanley Carrington could not perform the mission calmly...
Dialog_Action_990700070_108,"Good job, Stanley. But it seems that P.A.M.'s predictive power is nothing more than that."
Dialog_Action_990700070_109,"No, P.A.M.'s prediction is quite accurate."
Dialog_Action_990700070_110,"I do sometimes get blindsided by my anxiety and anger. But since I've made a few changes, I've realized that only by keeping a cool head can I master ever-changing situations."
Dialog_Action_990700070_111,It is true that my temper is very bad. But now I have learned to remain cool as a cucumber in critical moments. Like a small boat in a raging storm.
Dialog_Action_990700070_112,Only by keeping calm can one be a truly qualified agent.
Dialog_Action_990700071_101,"Mercenary work is complicated, yet so simple..."
Dialog_Action_990700071_102,"Accept the mission, find the target, kill the target, and get your pay. Everything seems so simple."
Dialog_Action_990700071_103,"But it costs not only your bullets, but also a piece of your heart."
Dialog_Action_990700071_104,"For a mercenary like me, there is nothing left in my heart."
Dialog_Action_990700071_105,"""Mission accomplished"" is all there is to it."
Dialog_Action_990700076_101,"After visiting the artist Pickman, I took interest in the Dunwich Mine Pit."
Dialog_Action_990700076_102,"What kind of secrets are buried in the bottomless pit? As a scholar, that question constantly tickles the back of my mind."
Dialog_Action_990700076_103,"What's more, my vague intuition tells me that, just maybe, I can find something related to the Rubal Hari Desert in the depths of this mine."
Dialog_Action_990700076_104,"Over the years, everyone, including my family, thought I was crazy. But I know I am sane and I am the only one who can find the truth in this world."
Dialog_Action_990700076_105,"There is a kind of whisper in this mine pit that can disturb your mind. I need to act carefully, and use bonfires to restore my sanity when necessary."
Dialog_Action_990700077_101,I have gradually felt the darkness in this mine pit. A kind of horror and madness that humans cannot comprehend thrives in here.
Dialog_Action_990700077_102,"My thoughts are often interrupted by those whispers, which evoke memories of the past and make me feel restless."
Dialog_Action_990700077_103,But I feel that I am on the right path. The path extending under my feet into the boundless darkness.
Dialog_Action_990700077_104,Can't stop. It won't let me stop.
Dialog_Action_990700078_101,"I meet those weird cultists that Pickman mentioned. Eyes blank, their hysterical, shrieking laughter echoes in the darkness of the pit."
Dialog_Action_990700078_102,"I have heard of Pickman's adventures here. If even a calm and self-restrained person like him was driven crazy by the endless chatter, there is no chance for ordinary people who stray into this place."
Dialog_Action_990700078_103,But I am different.
Dialog_Action_990700078_104,In order to return to that city... I must know more... it will let me know more...
Dialog_Action_990700079_101,"As I get deeper into this mine, I feel more and more fear crawling into my bones. The darkness that extends to the bottom of the Earth is like an endless universe. The farther I've ventured, the more it is clear my lack of understanding."
Dialog_Action_990700079_102,"I believe I am close to the center of this mine pit. I see more and more otherworldly things, strange creatures hiding in the darkness, and humans who have long since lost their minds."
Dialog_Action_990700079_103,Only by going deeper can I get the answer I need... but...
Dialog_Action_990700079_104,"I'm not sure now, whether I am worthy of this grace..."
Dialog_Action_990700080_101,"The whispers have disappeared, replaced by a deadly silence. The air here seems to absorb sound. I try to open my mouth and shout, but I can't hear my voice."
Dialog_Action_990700080_102,"I don't know if there is a problem with me mentally, but I am sure that I am very close to the answer."
Dialog_Action_990700080_103,"(There are sparkles in Lorenzo's eyes, murmurs in his mouth. He's as excited as someone finding a lost city hundreds of years ago. Perhaps only a pure lunatic can understand his joy. )"
Dialog_Action_990700080_104,"(In the darkness and silence, there is no living thing to respond to his madness. )"
Dialog_Action_990700081_101,Wh-where am I?
Dialog_Action_990700081_102,Complete darkness... how did I get here?
Dialog_Action_990700081_103,"Mistress of Mystery, is that you? You must help us, we have been attacked by Raiders!"
Dialog_Action_990700081_104,I... can you tell me how I got here?
Dialog_Action_990700081_105,"Don't you remember, Mistress of Mystery? In this apocalyptic world, you can only step forward and protect the Wastelanders while resisting the inhuman Raiders."
Dialog_Action_990700081_106,"Alright, I will protect you."
Dialog_Action_990700081_107,"The darkness here is disturbing. I must proceed carefully, remember the terrain here, and attack the enemy's weak points."
Dialog_Action_990700081_108,"Destroy the communicator here, and the Raiders will fall into chaos."
Dialog_Action_990700081_109,... Done. The Wastelanders are safe now.
Dialog_Action_990700081_110,"Thankfully, we are safe for now."
Dialog_Action_990700081_111,"So, I first have to figure out..."
Dialog_Action_990700081_112,"But there are too many Raiders outside, and I'm afraid we're just wasting time here."
Dialog_Action_990700081_113,"After all, my power is limited, and I cannot take care of all of you."
Dialog_Action_990700081_114,"Have you considered training more heroes like yourself, so there will be more Mistresses of Mystery to protect more people?"
Dialog_Action_990700081_115,This sounds reasonable... but what's with this sudden feeling of Déjà vu...
Dialog_Action_990700082_101,"Another settlement has been occupied by the Raiders, we need more Mistresses of Mystery!"
Dialog_Action_990700082_102,I understand.
Dialog_Action_990700082_103,The bomb has made orphans out of many children. I will adopt those kind-hearted children and train them to be protectors of the Wasteland.
Dialog_Action_990700082_104,The Raiders have locked up a little girl. I must find a way to rescue her.
Dialog_Action_990700082_105,Boo-hooo...
Dialog_Action_990700082_106,"It's okay, little girl, you are safe."
Dialog_Action_990700082_107,"Lil' girl, do you want to be a warrior like me, fighting against the vicious Raiders and protecting the people of the Wasteland?"
Dialog_Action_990700082_108,Protecting the people of the Wasteland?
Dialog_Action_990700082_109,"Exactly, just like the Mistress of Mystery."
Dialog_Action_990700082_110,But... who will protect you?
Dialog_Action_990700082_111,What?!?
Dialog_Action_990700082_112,What in blue blazes is that about...?
Dialog_Action_990700083_101,"The Mystic Order is getting stronger, while the Raiders continue rampaging more and more."
Dialog_Action_990700083_102,I... I want to take a break... Everything is wrong.
Dialog_Action_990700083_103,"How can you stop? Do you want to watch the Raiders burn, kill, and loot?"
Dialog_Action_990700083_104,Kill all the Raiders so we can be saved!
Dialog_Action_990700083_105,...
Dialog_Action_990700084_101,"Everything here is so weird, how can I get out of this place?"
Dialog_Action_990700084_102,"We need you, Mistress of Mystery!"
Dialog_Action_990700084_103,But who will protect the Mistress of Mystery?
Dialog_Action_990700084_104,You... are not real! What's wrong with me? I just want to get out of here!
Dialog_Action_990700084_105,"As long as you still cling to your ideals, you cannot leave this place."
Dialog_Action_990700084_106,Who are you? Where am I?
Dialog_Action_990700084_107,"Through the darkness, you can see the truth."
Dialog_Action_990700084_108,This is...
Dialog_Action_990700084_109,I remembered. That is the ending of the Mystic Order.
Dialog_Action_990700084_110,"Darkness and greed have long been rooted in the Mystic Order, and it was Shannon's daughter Olivia who betrayed everyone."
Dialog_Action_990700084_111,"In the end, no one was redeemed. Not even Olivia."
Dialog_Action_990700084_112,"Courage, tact, and compassion. Everything that the Mistress of Mystery represents looks so insignificant in the vast Wasteland."
Dialog_Action_990700084_113,"Now you finally understand. You are nothing but a bubble of past ideals, a false hope. The Wasteland does not need you to save it. You cannot save anyone."
Dialog_Action_990700084_114,Are you ready to accept reality?
Dialog_Action_990700084_115,...
Dialog_Action_990700084_116,"No, I refuse. There is always someone who needs to carry this heavy burden."
Dialog_Action_990700084_117,Then you must defeat me and prove yourself.
Dialog_Action_990700085_101,Are you ready?
Dialog_Action_990700085_102,As always.
Dialog_Action_990700085_103,So let's get started.
Dialog_Action_990700085_104,"Even in the darkest of depths there will always be a glimmer of light. Generation after generation have inherited the path of the Mistress of Mystery, bringing hope to the Wasteland."
Dialog_Action_990700085_105,"Very good. If one day you are confused about your ideals, I will be here waiting for you."
Dialog_Action_990700086_101,"As night falls, evil begins to breed in the shadows of Boston again. But all this can't escape the eyes of the Silver Shroud. He will once again walk in the darkness and bring the gangsters and criminals to justice!"
Dialog_Action_990700086_102,"Kent, we agreed not to play this on the radio..."
Dialog_Action_990700086_103,"Ha... I'm sorry, its a habit. Silver Shroud, the gangster we are looking for is hiding near you. But you have to hurry, your enemy may slip away soon."
Dialog_Action_990700086_104,"Hey, I'm always in a hurry. I'm used to it."
Dialog_Action_990700087_101,"Silver Shroud, this is your old friend Kent! I heard that the enemy you are facing this time is very dangerous, but some of his secret supplies are locked in a storage room."
Dialog_Action_990700087_102,Observe them carefully and maybe you can find out who has the key to the storage room.
Dialog_Action_990700088_101,"Silver Shroud, this is your old friend Kent. I heard that the gangster boss you are facing this time is very strong, and there are many nearby portals leading to God knows where."
Dialog_Action_990700088_102,"Replenish your supplies after defeating his men, it might make it easier for you to tackle the gangster boss."
Dialog_Action_990700088_103,"Also, be careful not to get lost!"
Dialog_Action_990700089_101,"Silver Shroud, this is your old friend Kent. I heard that the gangster boss you are looking for keeps himself protected by a myriad of traps."
Dialog_Action_990700089_102,"Silver Shroud must have a way to find a safe route, right?"
Dialog_Action_990700090_101,"Silver Shroud, this is your old friend Kent. This time you will be dealing with massive out-of-control robots just like the battle against Machine Master in the comics right? Haha!"
Dialog_Action_990700090_102,Only once you have killed all the robots here will the threat be completely eliminated!
Dialog_Action_990700090_103,"Be careful, some robots are protected by deadly traps. It is best to clear those traps before engaging in battle."
Dialog_Action_990700091_101,"In the first era, the Primordial War, when the shadows first stretched..."
Dialog_Action_990700091_102,"Wait a minute, I'm sorry, my mistake... You are here to listen to heavy metal music and watch the Doom Slayer kill demons. Certainly, you don't want to hear a long story from an unknown narrator."
Dialog_Action_990700091_103,So put on your headphones and enjoy this metal feast now!
Dialog_Action_990700096_101,"Hell yeah baby, let's start the comprehensive battle simulation on our brand new spokesperson!"
Dialog_Action_990700096_102,"Yes, boss! Brand new spokesperson: Nuka-Girl. Key equipment: Thirst Zapper, Cola space suit. First simulation initializing..."
Dialog_Action_990700096_103,"Uh, can I ask questions?"
Dialog_Action_990700096_104,"Of course, John. I am very open-minded, so feel free to ask me any questions you have."
Dialog_Action_990700096_105,Why are we conducting this simulation battle on Nuka-Girl? I don't think it's really necessary... we're not making super weapons...
Dialog_Action_990700096_106,"Shut up, John! God! I am the boss. I have the final say!"
Dialog_Action_990700096_107,(cries)
Dialog_Action_990700096_108,"According to the data I have collected, super strong and super hot female space fighters are the ultimate fantasy for modern urban men."
Dialog_Action_990700096_109,This simulated battle will help us to understand consumer psychology so that we can improve our sales strategy and character design.
Dialog_Action_990700096_110,"You know me, Sugar. Sure enough, you are my favorite super AI."
Dialog_Action_990700096_111,"System initialized. The simulation battle is about to begin. Three, two, one..."
Dialog_Action_990700100_101,"The test is complete, boss. How do you feel?"
Dialog_Action_990700100_102,"Per-fect! Nuka-Girl will definitely be an icon for the new generation! Even I have completely fallen in love with her... Speaking of which, I've got a great idea!"
Dialog_Action_990700100_103,"Do tell, boss."
Dialog_Action_990700100_104,"If I can transfer your AI into the body of a ""Synth"" who looks the same as a human being, will I be able to create a living Nuka-Girl? Just the thought has got my blood boiling!"
Dialog_Action_990700100_105,"An epic idea, boss, but according to my survey data, it will be at least 150 years before similar ""Synth"" technologies can be developed..."
Dialog_Action_990700100_106,Well...
Dialog_Action_990700101_101,"(Male voice) Dr. Zimmer, if you are hearing this recording I have been gone for a long time. I want to escape from the Institute. I want to be free. I know you will come for me, but as long as you can't find me I will live my life as someone else."
Dialog_Action_990700101_102,"(Turns off the holographic cassette recording, murmuring) You are too self-righteous. You left too many clues, the least of which is that you are still alive."
Dialog_Action_990700101_103,Clean the battlefield and see if there are any clues remaining after this horde of idiot Raiders have trampled the place.
Dialog_Action_990700101_104,A holographic cassette. Some info should be on it.
Dialog_Action_990700101_105,"Okay, let's listen and find out where you have gone."
Dialog_Action_990700102_101,"(Female voice) Good and trustworthy doctor, do you know about Synths? They are robots that look exactly like us. I know one of them. He's trying to escape, so I want to find a surgeon who can change his appearance. Can you help him?"
Dialog_Action_990700102_102,"(Turns off the holographic cassette recording, murmuring) Change appearance? Good idea. Certainly a consciousness has been awakened. I'll find the doctor and see what he's turned you into."
Dialog_Action_990700102_103,It seems that the doctor is not here. Look for other clues.
Dialog_Action_990700102_104,Another holographic cassette. The doctor's message.
Dialog_Action_990700102_105,"(Male voice) The structure of the Synth is too complicated. Only the Railroad can help him. The Railroad says it's going to help him fulfill his wish. It's said that they are going to find a ""core circuit neuron.” I have never heard of this."
Dialog_Action_990700102_106,"""Core circuit neuron!?” It seems that this organization is extremely intelligent."
Dialog_Action_990700103_101,"Dr. Zimmer, are you sure there are ""core circuit neurons"" here?"
Dialog_Action_990700103_102,No mistake. I have heard that there was once a doctor with a high level of skill here.
Dialog_Action_990700103_103,"By the way, I found this holographic cassette on the doorstep."
Dialog_Action_990700103_104,"(Male voice) Do you remember the secret project that helps the Synths, the one I told you about before? The senior members of the Railroad told me that they have already obtained the materials for facial reconstruction, all they need is this ""core circuit neuron.” I heard that someone here can make it."
Dialog_Action_990700103_105,"That's right, it looks like they're here. We gotta hurry up!"
Dialog_Action_990700103_106,"Dr. Zimmer, there is no one here and no trace of a ""core circuit neuron.”"
Dialog_Action_990700103_107,"It seems that they have retrieved it, and retreated. Look for any clues."
Dialog_Action_990700103_108,There is a new record in this terminal.
Dialog_Action_990700103_109,"The facial reconstruction work on the Federation Synth has been completed, and he followed me to Rivet City. As long as his memory is replaced, he can become a real human."
Dialog_Action_990700103_110,"A real human? No way! Let's go. Kill the remaining guys, and then we can go to Rivet City!"
Dialog_Action_990700104_101,Why do I feel like someone's trying to lead us there?
Dialog_Action_990700104_102,"Indeed, it's like someone knows what we are looking for, and has generously leaked the info to us."
Dialog_Action_990700104_103,"Look, it seems that terminal over there has a message."
Dialog_Action_990700104_104,"I know who you are and what you want to do. I am waiting for you at the lowest level, and I will tell you everything you want to know."
Dialog_Action_990700104_105,Let's go. We'll meet this guy!
Dialog_Action_990700104_106,"Nobody's here. Except for us, there is not a soul."
Dialog_Action_990700104_107,Escaped? But he left this (raises the holographic cassette in their hand).
Dialog_Action_990700104_108,"Harsh as the environment of the Capital Wasteland is, I have found that the people here have compassion never before seen in the Commonwealth. The people here are more friendly to me, and they will not discriminate against me just because I am a Synth."
Dialog_Action_990700104_109,"I'll be free in a few days. Now let me say thank you, thank you, to the Railroad and thank you, Doctor Pinkerton. Please record this, as I will soon forget all of my past."
Dialog_Action_990700104_110,"... Damn it, he succeeded."
Dialog_Action_990700105_101,Over there. Don't do anything until it goes deep underground.
Dialog_Action_990700105_102,Understood!
Dialog_Action_990700105_103,"Dr. Zimmer, what are you doing?"
Dialog_Action_990700105_104,"Nothing, we just want to return it to the rightful owner."
Dialog_Action_990700105_105,Wh-what do you mean?
Dialog_Action_990700105_106,"I mean, we want to bring you back to the Institute!"
Dialog_Action_990700105_107,What if I say no?
Dialog_Action_990700105_108,You don't get to choose. Now!
Dialog_Action_990700105_109,Tell me! Why hunt me?!
Dialog_Action_990700105_110,Don't you know who you are?
Dialog_Action_990700105_111,"Council member Harkness, director of the Security Bureau of Rivet City."
Dialog_Action_990700105_112,Do you know what you were before?
Dialog_Action_990700105_113,What I was? What do you mean?
Dialog_Action_990700105_114,"Yes, you were an object. You were not a person, at least not a real person."
Dialog_Action_990700105_115,Nonsense! I am a human being. The real Harkness!
Dialog_Action_990700105_116,"No, you are not. Close your eyes and think carefully. (While speaking, he messes with something behind Harkness)"
Dialog_Action_990700105_117,"No... Noooo No! Nothing is real, all fake! You are lying. It's all an illusion!"
Dialog_Action_990700105_118,Take your time and reflect on it. No rush.
Dialog_Action_990700105_119,"No!!!! (With this roar, Harkness' body begins shaking)"
Dialog_Action_990700105_120,"Poor thing, this is but a dream. Now that you have woken up, come back with me."
Dialog_Action_990700106_101,"Ask for mercy, you tin can! Do not resist you hunk of metal!"
Dialog_Action_990700106_102,"Shut up, insect girl!"
Dialog_Action_990700106_103,"Call me queen or your majesty, you piece of garbage! Soon, you and your garbage will become nourishment for my cute Antagonizers!"
Dialog_Action_990700106_104,"Come out, coward! Your garbage has been cleaned up!"
Dialog_Action_990700106_105,"Humph, you're lucky this time, but let's wait and see!"
Dialog_Action_990700107_101,"You dirty, dirty tin can! You launched a sneak attacked on my nest! And set fire to my cuties!"
Dialog_Action_990700107_102,"One must use special tactics against a super villain! Tell you what, I prepared some small gifts for you. I hope you can accept this surprise!"
Dialog_Action_990700107_103,"Yeah! I'll be waiting for your surprise! Super ""hero!”"
Dialog_Action_990700107_104,"Hahahahahaha, you truly are a super bug villain. Looks like my little gifts will not satisfy you."
Dialog_Action_990700107_105,You're hiding again! You coward! Show yourself!
Dialog_Action_990700107_106,"I'm done playing. You should go and see your cuties as soon as possible. Hahaha, catch you later!"
Dialog_Action_990700107_107,Jerk! I won't let you go!
Dialog_Action_990700108_101,"Yeah! Let's see where you are hiding this time! Tin Can, come on out!"
Dialog_Action_990700108_102,"I'll count down from three. If you don't talk, I will tear down the house!"
Dialog_Action_990700108_103,3...2...1...
Dialog_Action_990700108_104,Uh...! Not here!
Dialog_Action_990700108_105,Little cuties! Rush in! Burn it all!!!
Dialog_Action_990700108_106,So many ambushes in this tin can's home! This should be the deepest area. Look around and see if there's any good stuff to take.
Dialog_Action_990700108_107,"Hey, it must be the freaky Ant Girl who's listening to this recording. Are you satisfied with all my traps? Hahaha, just how many cuties have vanished here this time?"
Dialog_Action_990700108_108,Jerk! You set me up!
Dialog_Action_990700108_109,"Am I making you mad again? Don't worry, I'll give you a chance for revenge. There is an abandoned subway station not far from the Canterbury public facilities. I'll be waiting for you there!"
Dialog_Action_990700108_110,Jerk! Just you wait!
Dialog_Action_990700109_101,"(Roars) Here I am, tin can! You can't escape me this time."
Dialog_Action_990700109_102,Come on! I'll wait for you ahead! Watch out! There's a surprise.
Dialog_Action_990700109_103,... Is this the surprise you prepared for me?
Dialog_Action_990700109_104,"So, are you surprised!? This is a super weapon, built from pre-war technology!"
Dialog_Action_990700109_105,Hahaha! Are you trying to provoke the Antagonizer Queen!?! Come on! Show the Queen how powerful it is!
Dialog_Action_990700109_106,It's over... that's it?
Dialog_Action_990700109_107,What the hell!? Why did it fall apart!? Was this not enough firepower!? There must be something wrong!
Dialog_Action_990700109_108,"Give up already, your partner can't save you. Today, the ""superhero"" is about to kneel down to the Antagonizer Queen the ""super villain!!”"
Dialog_Action_990700109_109,No!!!! Impossible! The righteous superhero will never give up so easily! Pull back!
Dialog_Action_990700109_110,Curses. They ran away again! What kind of super villain are they?
Dialog_Action_990700110_101,"Filthy bug, things will never be the same as before! Accept justice from the superhero!"
Dialog_Action_990700110_102,Bring it on! Let me see what tricks this superhero has!
Dialog_Action_990700110_103,"Whoa, a big guy! Interesting!"
Dialog_Action_990700110_104,This is an enhanced version of the Sentry Bot. Don't sell it short. I've strengthened its armor and artillery.
Dialog_Action_990700110_105,Come on. Cut the crap.
Dialog_Action_990700110_106,"Don't be hasty, we might have to fight like this forever. How about we make an agreement. If I win... You can no longer hurt the Dwellers."
Dialog_Action_990700110_107,I promise you. But there is a problem. You make it sound as if your lousy metal bots never hurt anyone.
Dialog_Action_990700110_108,Why is it that? A Sentry Bot with such tremendous strength cannot defeat you!? Why can't a superhero defeat a super villain!?!?
Dialog_Action_990700110_109,Give up! Follow the Antagonizer Queen and we will destroy mankind together!
Dialog_Action_990700110_110,"No, I want to stop you, although I have no strength to fight you again! Evil will not prevail over justice. I will fight you to the end! I will definitely be back!"
Dialog_Action_990700110_111,...That guy is so annoying.
Dialog_Action_990700111_101,"This is the place of recruitment that was advertised, but it doesn't look like a stronghold of the Brotherhood of Steel. Aww, hopefully we can find some clues here."
Dialog_Action_990700111_102,This terminal has the logo of the Brotherhood of Steel. Let me see what's on it. (Turns on terminal)
Dialog_Action_990700111_103,A message from yesterday (clicks on the file)
Dialog_Action_990700111_104,"Mayday. Mayday. This is Sam, Vertibird pilot for the Brotherhood of Steel. My Vertibird got hit by the Enclave and I have to make an emergency landing. The emergency landing site is near the Police Station. Calling for support. Calling for support."
Dialog_Action_990700111_105,"I hope that pilot is still alive. If I find him, I should be able to reach the Brotherhood of Steel!"
Dialog_Action_990700112_101,Is this where they landed? Why do I hear a fight up ahead?
Dialog_Action_990700112_102,This is our turf. You Enclaves want a date with death?
Dialog_Action_990700112_103,"Don't spout nonsense. We are on a search and rescue mission, but I don't mind disposing of a few more pieces of trash. Prepare to fire!"
Dialog_Action_990700112_104,"The enemy of my enemy is my friend, so maybe I should help those Raiders."
Dialog_Action_990700112_105,"The gang owes you one, young lady."
Dialog_Action_990700112_106,"Yes, I'm looking for a pilot with the Brotherhood of Steel, can you help?"
Dialog_Action_990700112_107,The Bird that fell out of the sky the other day? I heard my brother report that the pilot managed to escape and went west.
Dialog_Action_990700112_108,"Thank you, ""Mr. Big Boss.”"
Dialog_Action_990700112_109,"Wait, there are Super Mutants and the Enclave to the west. Our gang has a code of conduct. Since you have saved me, my brothers will help you if they are around! And I will escort you till the end."
Dialog_Action_990700112_110,"Thank you very much. Without further ado, let's get going."
Dialog_Action_990700113_101,The Gang's scouts reported that the pilot headed toward the factory.
Dialog_Action_990700113_102,Then let's go in and look for clues.
Dialog_Action_990700113_103,"Young lady, do be careful. The Enclave soldiers are not a joke."
Dialog_Action_990700113_104,I'm not worried with you by my side.
Dialog_Action_990700113_105,"Don't worry, I will protect you. Ready to fight!"
Dialog_Action_990700113_106,This is... a holographic cassette.
Dialog_Action_990700113_107,Here is a terminal to play it.
Dialog_Action_990700113_108,"I'm Sam. I managed to escape and came to this warehouse after crash landing. However, the number of Enclave soldiers have been growing over the past few days and I can't stay here any longer. I must get the out of here as soon as possible. The map shows that there is a school 5 km away from the warehouse..."
Dialog_Action_990700113_109,There's nobody here. The pilot must have survived and headed to the school.
Dialog_Action_990700113_110,Let's go then.
Dialog_Action_990700114_101,"Finally, we have the Brotherhood pilot cornered."
Dialog_Action_990700114_102,"Yeah, that idiot caused us a lot of trouble the last couple of days. I heard that he has important information about the giant fighting robot of the Brotherhood. HQ wants him alive."
Dialog_Action_990700114_103,"Great, it looks like the pilot is still there!"
Dialog_Action_990700114_104,Who is there?!
Dialog_Action_990700114_105,Go to hell!
Dialog_Action_990700114_106,Finally. After so much trouble!
Dialog_Action_990700114_107,Who are you? How did you get in here? Guard!
Dialog_Action_990700114_108,The rescue team?
Dialog_Action_990700114_109,You guys? Are you here to save me?
Dialog_Action_990700114_110,"Basically. I want to join the Brotherhood of Steel, but I heard your distress signal at the recruitment site. So I tracked it all the way here... I'm an expert with grenades."
Dialog_Action_990700114_111,"Your courage is admirable. The Brotherhood of Steel needs talent like yours. I can put in a good word for you, but before that, we have to find a tall building to place a beacon so we can contact the Brotherhood headquarters in the Capital. I have important information with me, and it must not fall into the hands of the Enclave."
Dialog_Action_990700115_101,"There are many Enclave soldiers in this building, but this is also the only place suitable for placing beacons."
Dialog_Action_990700115_102,It's my childhood dream to fight side by side with the Brotherhood of Steel.
Dialog_Action_990700115_103,Destroy all invaders!
Dialog_Action_990700115_104,Watch out!
Dialog_Action_990700115_105,"Miss, stay behind me!"
Dialog_Action_990700115_106,"The beacon's installed, and Elder Lyons is coming for an evac via Vertibird."
Dialog_Action_990700115_107,It's an honor to meet the legendary Elder.
Dialog_Action_990700115_108,"Miss, we should take flight now. After all, the Brotherhood of Steel and our gang are at odds."
Dialog_Action_990700115_109,Thank you for your help and I hope to see you again in the future.
Dialog_Action_990700115_110,"Teehee, I have a hunch that we will meet again."
Dialog_Action_990700115_111,"Sam, we've been out of touch for a few days. We were all worried. It's great to see you in one piece. Is the activation password of Freedom Pioneer still safe?"
Dialog_Action_990700115_112,All in this cassette.
Dialog_Action_990700115_113,"Great, our general attack plan for Crow Ridge can continue with the help of James' son."
Dialog_Action_990700115_114,Who is this?
Dialog_Action_990700115_115,"Her name's Jessica, and she brought someone to rescue me from the Enclave."
Dialog_Action_990700115_116,"Thank you for your courage and dedication, sister. I am willing to help in anyway I can."
Dialog_Action_990700115_117,"Elder, my childhood dream was to join the Brotherhood of Steel and fight by your side. I want to uphold justice in the Wasteland."
Dialog_Action_990700115_118,I can vouch for her. Her actions truly proved her mettle.
Dialog_Action_990700115_119,"Sister, welcome to the Brotherhood of Steel!"
Dialog_Action_990700115_120,Invincible!
Dialog_Action_990700115_121,Invincible!
Dialog_Action_990700116_101,How boring. Are Minutemen only capable of these trivial missions now?
Dialog_Action_990700116_102,"Clint, please don't say that. Whatever the mission, it is for the people of the Wasteland!"
Dialog_Action_990700116_103,Scram! Enough nonsense!
Dialog_Action_990700116_104,Another bunch of trash. What good can purging those small fries do for the Wasteland?
Dialog_Action_990700116_105,You tell me. Are you a Minuteman?
Dialog_Action_990700116_106,Do you know the Minutemen?
Dialog_Action_990700116_107,"I do. They used to be awesome. Back then, you had larger numbers and everything was a breeze for you. Now, you are just a group of old, weak, sick, men. And you still want to protect the people of the Wasteland? You can't even protect yourself!"
Dialog_Action_990700116_108,"(The blue veins on his forehead bulge twice) Cut it out! (Bang, the Raider falls dead)"
Dialog_Action_990700116_109,"Clint, don't take it to heart! They don't understand the Minutemen."
Dialog_Action_990700116_110,But I do.
Dialog_Action_990700117_101,"The Minutemen are over, I must plan a way out as soon as possible. The Raiders are lame. They've got sand for brains. Don't listen to them."
Dialog_Action_990700117_102,(The conversation of Gunners drifts in) News has it that the escaped Minutemen have fled here. Let's hurry and take them out.
Dialog_Action_990700117_103,"Yes, the ones hiding here must be little shrimp. We should finish them quick and go after the big fish. Heard that Colonel Hollis of the Minutemen is still there, we have to hurry up!"
Dialog_Action_990700117_104,"Tsk, I'm a small shrimp!?"
Dialog_Action_990700117_105,Who called me a small shrimp just now?
Dialog_Action_990700117_106,"I did, but I'm talking about the Minutemen! And who are you?"
Dialog_Action_990700117_107,"I'm one of them, why?"
Dialog_Action_990700117_108,You are not like any of them. You can fight and you talk different too.
Dialog_Action_990700117_109,"In this case, I'm done talking. I take partial credit for the siege of Quincy. I'm fed up with the Minutemen, so I'll ask a quick question. How can I join the Gunners?"
Dialog_Action_990700117_110,If you let us go you will be considered a Gunner!
Dialog_Action_990700118_101,Word is that Colonel Hollis and other remnants of the Minutemen should be here.
Dialog_Action_990700118_102,"In the face of your former superiors and subordinates, don't get soft or you're dead."
Dialog_Action_990700118_103,I asked to come. You think I'd come if I was unsure of myself?
Dialog_Action_990700118_104,"Who knows? So, who is your target!?"
Dialog_Action_990700118_105,...Humph
Dialog_Action_990700118_106,How about Hollis? Didn't we bring him to you alive?
Dialog_Action_990700118_107,(Points to the corpse in the colonel's costume in the corner) Over there.
Dialog_Action_990700118_108,Splendid. You killed your superior. It seems that you have given up on the Minutemen.
Dialog_Action_990700118_109,"Clint, where's the Colonel?"
Dialog_Action_990700118_110,(Looks at the corpse in the corner)
Dialog_Action_990700118_111,"Damn, you will pay for that!"
Dialog_Action_990700118_112,"You have shown you are truly done with them. You've earned out trust, Clint. You are officially one of the Gunners! Lieutenant!"
Dialog_Action_990700119_101,The trials are not easy. Many have been sent to play this game. Are you ready?
Dialog_Action_990700119_102,(Radio) I will be there soon!
Dialog_Action_990700119_103,(Radio) Why listen to him? Let's go by ourselves! I don't trust him!
Dialog_Action_990700119_104,Get lost if you don't trust him! For heaven's sake!
Dialog_Action_990700119_105,"(Radio) Yeah, this trial is all screwed up with you there! (Turns off the radio)"
Dialog_Action_990700119_106,"(Radio) Clint, you are strong in combat, but Tessa is no weakling. I'm worried..."
Dialog_Action_990700119_107,"I know what you mean, go ahead. I can do it by myself, if you run into trouble, call me!"
Dialog_Action_990700119_108,(Radio) Roger.
Dialog_Action_990700119_109,"I'm finally here and still so many ""bugs"" in the way."
Dialog_Action_990700119_110,Do you think this is easy? How funny. Those fire extinguishers on the road were left to you by your teammates!
Dialog_Action_990700119_111,"... I know, so I must beat you!"
Dialog_Action_990700119_112,Cut the crap. Just do it!
Dialog_Action_990700119_113,Huff... huff... Did I pass?
Dialog_Action_990700119_114,"A wonderful battle. You passed the trial. This gun is for you, snatched from a Brotherhood Knight, and modified by many gun masters. It is a fantastic weapon!"
Dialog_Action_990700119_115,"So, give it a name."
Dialog_Action_990700119_116,"(Takes the gun) Incredible! I'll call it, ""Well-Wishes!”"
Dialog_Action_990700120_101,"The Raiders were strong this time. They acted in an orderly manner, with impressive marksmanship. They are not like the usual lunatics we have met before."
Dialog_Action_990700120_102,"(Radio) Yes, they are scary. Our defenses will not hold for long!"
Dialog_Action_990700120_103,(Radio) Blame it on our lieutenant.
Dialog_Action_990700120_104,"(Radio) Tessa, shut up, if it weren't for Clint, we would have already died!"
Dialog_Action_990700120_105,"Lets get down to business. I think there is someone in charge behind the scenes. To kill the snake, chop off its head."
Dialog_Action_990700120_106,"(Radio) Okay, I'll go with you!"
Dialog_Action_990700120_107,"No, you and Tessa will fend off other Raiders, and I will take out this mystery leader."
Dialog_Action_990700120_108,(Radio)... Look out for yourself!
Dialog_Action_990700120_109,"(Catches sight of the Enclave Commander wearing advanced power armor) What kind of power armor is that? So well made, it looks so powerful! Which faction are you from!?"
Dialog_Action_990700120_110,"This is a hybrid power armor, made of T60 and T51. Not bad, indeed. It looks like you are the strongest one among the local Gunners. You don't have to know which faction I came from, since you will die today."
Dialog_Action_990700120_111,Why command the Raiders to attack Quincy? I don't remember messing with a guy like you.
Dialog_Action_990700120_112,"Cut it out! Raise your gun! If you beat me, I will tell you!"
Dialog_Action_990700120_113,You've got tough! That's it for today. Seems that Quincy's Gunners won't be eliminated that easily.
Dialog_Action_990700120_114,Who the heck are you?
Dialog_Action_990700120_115,"All you need to know is that we are the real owners of this land, goodbye!"
Dialog_Action_990700121_101,It's so dark in here...
Dialog_Action_990700121_102,I emerged from the shadows... (disappears)
Dialog_Action_990700121_103,Hey!? Where's he gone?
Dialog_Action_990700121_104,Shadows...
Dialog_Action_990700121_105,Wait. Please wait! The Mistress of Mystery is in trouble! Come with me.
Dialog_Action_990700121_106,...(nods)
Dialog_Action_990700121_107,"Listen well, when you encounter a strong enemy, you can't fight separately."
Dialog_Action_990700121_108,...(disappears)
Dialog_Action_990700121_109,Hmm? Gone again?? Damn it!!!
Dialog_Action_990700122_101,"Well, Manta Man seems to have stepped on a trap and gotten stuck. Luckily, he knows when to ask me for help. Comb the area."
Dialog_Action_990700122_102,You finally came to save me!
Dialog_Action_990700122_103,How did you fall into such an obvious trap?
Dialog_Action_990700122_104,"It's a long story, I heard a mermaid singing ahead... I'll tell you what, I have never heard such a beautiful voice like that in all my life."
Dialog_Action_990700122_105,"Uh, alright then. Now, let's get out of here quickly."
Dialog_Action_990700122_106,"Finally got you out, but next time you have to be more careful. Don't be so rash."
Dialog_Action_990700122_107,"Okay, definitely next time."
Dialog_Action_990700122_108,(Falls) Ahhh~~~~~~~~ (Thump)
Dialog_Action_990700122_109,No!!!! Manta Man!!
Dialog_Action_990700123_101,"Well, I don't know where the Mistress of Mystery is this time. I wish she would wait for me."
Dialog_Action_990700123_102,Well here you are.
Dialog_Action_990700123_103,Why are you locked up? I thought you were the best at picking locks?
Dialog_Action_990700123_104,"Forget it, let's just go..."
Dialog_Action_990700123_105,"Uh, all right. Let's leave here quickly."
Dialog_Action_990700123_106,Target down. Mission accomplished. Prepare for the next operation.
Dialog_Action_990700123_107,"Wait, Lady! Shouldn't we make a plan first?"
Dialog_Action_990700123_108,"No, no, no, a plan restricts our freedom to act. We'll play it by ear!"
Dialog_Action_990700123_109,Hey... wait for me!
Dialog_Action_990700124_101,Aww!
Dialog_Action_990700124_102,"Hold on, let's observe the enemy's movements first... Grognak!"
Dialog_Action_990700124_103,What? An enemy attack? We are not ready yet!
Dialog_Action_990700124_104,Run!
Dialog_Action_990700124_105,I just can't keep up! It seems that we'll only find Grognak by tracking his trail on the ground.
Dialog_Action_990700124_106,"Finally found you. Don't run away. We are a team, got it?"
Dialog_Action_990700124_107,(Gradually calms down).
Dialog_Action_990700124_108,"Listen, we'll outflank them. Hey!"
Dialog_Action_990700124_109,Aww!
Dialog_Action_990700124_110,"Youngster, that's not fair play!"
Dialog_Action_990700124_111,Boss down. Everyone run!
Dialog_Action_990700124_112,(Pants) We are... in a.
Dialog_Action_990700124_113,Wowww!
Dialog_Action_990700124_114,I'm not finished yet!
Dialog_Action_990700125_101,Perfect. We are all together again! Dr. Brainwash will feel the power of the Unstoppable League!
Dialog_Action_990700125_102,"I have been waiting for you for a long time! The Silver Shroud, The Mistress of Mystery, Grognak, Manta Man. And... who are you?"
Dialog_Action_990700125_103,I'm-
Dialog_Action_990700125_104,Aww!
Dialog_Action_990700125_105,"Wait, I haven't said my name yet!"
Dialog_Action_990700125_106,I'll be back! Silver Shroud! Mistress of Mystery! Grognak! Manta Man! And... what was your name again?
Dialog_Action_990700125_107,I'm the Inspector.
Dialog_Action_990700125_108,My grand debut is ruined...
Dialog_Action_990700126_101,Escape... Kill...!
Dialog_Action_990700126_102,Warning. Warning! A test subject has escaped! Considered extremely dangerous! Facilities on high alert!
Dialog_Action_990700126_103,Roar!
Dialog_Action_990700126_104,Roar!
Dialog_Action_990700126_105,It escaped! Call someone! Don't let it get away!
Dialog_Action_990700127_101,Target found! Ready for combat!
Dialog_Action_990700127_102,Roar! ...Kill!
Dialog_Action_990700128_101,Hungry...Food...
Dialog_Action_990700128_102,"Th-this is... a Deathclaw! No... this isn't... this is bigger than the target, and... that red skin!"
Dialog_Action_990700128_103,Roar! Food!!!!
Dialog_Action_990700128_104,Run!! Run!!
Dialog_Action_990700128_105,Roar!!
Dialog_Action_990700128_106,"(Takes out a walkie-talkie from the shadows) Chief. I found a very interesting Deathclaw, do you want me to follow it and observe?"
Dialog_Action_990700128_107,"Keep an eye on it, and protect it if necessary."
Dialog_Action_990700128_108,Go! Get out!! Get... out!
Dialog_Action_990700128_109,"Don't be afraid, we will help you!"
Dialog_Action_990700128_110,Humans! Can't...be...trusted.
Dialog_Action_990700128_111,Then it's good that I'm not human.
Dialog_Action_990700129_101,There is... a sense of... danger... Wh-wh-why would I come here?
Dialog_Action_990700129_102,"Incredible, you can speak in full sentences now! Here are some machines that have chased you before. Eradicate them."
Dialog_Action_990700129_103,Re-venge! Yes...!
Dialog_Action_990700129_104,"Let's split up, be sure to look out for traps."
Dialog_Action_990700129_105,Roar!!!
Dialog_Action_990700129_106,"Reporting in, Chief: the target has been tested. It is strong, capable of avoiding damage and using tools. It's vastly different from normal Deathclaws. Obviously a open-minded creature, with high research value. Report over."
Dialog_Action_990700129_107,"(Walkie-talkie) Roger, take it back to Greenetech Genetics."
Dialog_Action_990700130_101,To think such a place exists... We must be as ill-informed as the Enclave.
Dialog_Action_990700130_102,"If it isn't Colonel Augustus, what brings you here?"
Dialog_Action_990700130_103,"I'm here to get my Enclave gear... very precious stuff. I know you have worked so hard to get this far, but the Enclave will not be kind to thieves. You may live if you submit to the Enclave now."
Dialog_Action_990700130_104,"You are talking about the Mount Mabel Monster. Since it is willing to reside with the Institute, it is now a part of the Institute. You can forget about taking it away!"
Dialog_Action_990700130_105,Thank-you!
Dialog_Action_990700130_106,"Then we're done talking. Take it back, and burn this place to the ground!"
Dialog_Action_990700130_107,Roar... kill!
Dialog_Action_990700130_108,"Retreat! Retreat! We underestimated this beast, and this mysterious faction!"
Dialog_Action_990700130_109,What you see is only part of our Institute. You don't know anything about us.
Dialog_Action_990700130_110,"This time we made a mistake, but the strength of the Enclave is beyond your imagination! We will retrieve all that belongs to the Enclave!"
Dialog_Action_990700130_111,Stay in the Institute with peace of mind. No one can take you away as long as the Institute is still here.
Dialog_Action_990700130_112,"However, you will need to help us with our research. I don't believe you'll mind."
Dialog_Action_990700131_101,"(Angrily) Vick, why do you treat them like this!"
Dialog_Action_990700131_102,Because I am the ruler.
Dialog_Action_990700131_103,Can a ruler take away their subjects' lives at will?!?!
Dialog_Action_990700131_104,"Of course, Hancock. I hope one day, when you get this right, you can look back on what you're saying right now. Wake up, this is a world where the law of the jungle prevails!"
Dialog_Action_990700131_105,"I know you are not convinced, but I can give you a chance to overthrow me! I'll be waiting for you in the depths. Let me see if the Ghoul will be alright with radiation everywhere!"
Dialog_Action_990700131_106,"Hancock, is that the best you can do? That's right, you are just a homeless Ghoul."
Dialog_Action_990700131_107,(Whispers) Is there no way I can stop him?
Dialog_Action_990700132_101,"If we are not accepted by the world and cannot enter secular places, then we will build a paradise by ourselves! Will you follow me?"
Dialog_Action_990700132_102,We will!
Dialog_Action_990700132_103,"Hancock, what do you want to do? Do you want to overthrow Vick?"
Dialog_Action_990700132_104,Do you still want to follow someone that cruel? Maybe the next person to get killed by him will be you.
Dialog_Action_990700132_105,"I'm dying, but I still want to tell you that I hope you can truly overthrow his rule. We are forced to do as he says."
Dialog_Action_990700132_106,I certainly will.
Dialog_Action_990700133_101,"Because of Hancock, we are going to kill you. If you must blame someone, blame Hancock!"
Dialog_Action_990700133_102,"Would we get to live if it weren't for Hancock? If our choices are only death or justice, why not fight?!?!"
Dialog_Action_990700133_103,Go to hell!
Dialog_Action_990700133_104,Stop!
Dialog_Action_990700133_105,"Hancock's here, run!"
Dialog_Action_990700134_101,"The Raiders are cruel, blinded by their power! It's time for them to admit their mistakes. Let's rescue our partners."
Dialog_Action_990700134_102,"Do you think you will win? The weak are food to be eaten by the strong. When Boss Vick comes out, it will be your end!"
Dialog_Action_990700134_103,"The strong are not obligated to subjugate the weak, they are free to choose to protect those who cannot protect themselves. Now that I am stronger, it's time to make a promise, Vick, let's fight!"
Dialog_Action_990700135_101,"Vick, it's time to settle it all."
Dialog_Action_990700135_102,You don't really think that your kindness can defeat me?
Dialog_Action_990700135_103,"It's not important whether my kindness can defeat you, but your tyranny will definitely end!"
Dialog_Action_990700135_104,"You are too young, Hancock, to understand the cruelty of the world. Do you think you are strong enough to protect everyone?"
Dialog_Action_990700135_105,At least I can protect the people you oppress.
Dialog_Action_990700135_106,"Let's fight then, just like before!"
Dialog_Action_990700135_107,"How come? Why did I lose! Impossible, this is impossible!"
Dialog_Action_990700135_108,"Vick, wake up from power that blinds you and look at the people around you. You lost. You completely lost."
Dialog_Action_990700135_109,I can't possibly lose. It is impossible for you to defeat me.
Dialog_Action_990700135_110,"Yeah, I can't beat you. You lost because of your own tyranny, Vick. You will never win the hearts of the people."
Dialog_Action_990700135_111,"To the enemy I am a merciless cold wind, but to my honest and friendly companions, I will be their eternal ally. I will always stand by justice, always, until death."
Dialog_Action_990700136_101,What do you get from taking our territory?
Dialog_Action_990700136_102,"Surrender, fragile aliens. I will eradicate this strange sect and take everything from you!"
Dialog_Action_990700136_103,You know nothing about the power of the Atom!
Dialog_Action_990700136_104,You are foolish enough to violate the Children of Atom?
Dialog_Action_990700136_105,"Such horrific strength. Your spirit for defending the land is admirable, but we will not let you off easy!"
Dialog_Action_990700137_101,Are you as strong as I heard?
Dialog_Action_990700137_102,"Conflict is unnecessary, mutants!"
Dialog_Action_990700137_103,Mutants gotta become stronger! Mutants must defeat you!
Dialog_Action_990700137_104,"What an imbecile. You have been instigated, separated, and others are just using you to take revenge."
Dialog_Action_990700137_105,"Then we'll bring you down first, get stronger and then take them out!"
Dialog_Action_990700137_106,We are not strong enough. But we will be back!
Dialog_Action_990700137_107,"(Sighs) Hey, there's no other way around."
Dialog_Action_990700138_101,"We are back, and this time we brought a new friend, Mother Isolde. Are you still able to protect your children?"
Dialog_Action_990700138_102,The Atom will protect us!
Dialog_Action_990700138_103,"Then let us behold the greatness of the Atom, hahahahaha!"
Dialog_Action_990700138_104,What is this for?
Dialog_Action_990700138_105,Is there any point?
Dialog_Action_990700138_106,Different beliefs. The Children of Atom must be conquered! We will meet again in the future!
Dialog_Action_990700138_107,"Humph, no matter how many times you come, I will kick you out!"
Dialog_Action_990700139_101,"Hey you big loaf, don't you guys want to be stronger? I'm here, but if you can't defeat me this time, never fight me again!"
Dialog_Action_990700139_102,Mutants will not lose. Mutants will become stronger! Mutants will fight with you!
Dialog_Action_990700139_103,All this is not true. Mutants will not lose!
Dialog_Action_990700139_104,"That's it. Sweet dreams be upon you. I hope we can live in peace, even for now."
Dialog_Action_990700140_101,The Atom has given me the power to make these outsiders succumb to the fear of the Children of Atom!
Dialog_Action_990700140_102,(Voice in the distance) This power station has been in disrepair for a long time and the leak is a bit serious.
Dialog_Action_990700140_103,"(Voice in the distance) Yeah, tell everyone to be careful and don't get hurt. There's a large number of us."
Dialog_Action_990700140_104,They are too many. Forget about fighting head-on. We gotta figure out a way to pass through the areas with the leak.
Dialog_Action_990700140_105,What kind of power is that? It's beyond the power of our most sophisticated equipment.
Dialog_Action_990700140_106,Atomic Power. Your equipment is no different from rags in front of the Atomic Power!
Dialog_Action_990700140_107,Wh-why can you use such power? Don't you know that you are hurting yourself?
Dialog_Action_990700140_108,Dedicating yourself to the Atom is the most pious belief!
Dialog_Action_990700140_109,"Hey, who is really ignorant?"
Dialog_Action_990700141_101,The little girl over there is being chased by a monster. It's exactly the same as what I saw in Preli back then. I must save her!
Dialog_Action_990700141_102,(Wasteland language) ￥*#&@U@##
Dialog_Action_990700141_103,What did you say?
Dialog_Action_990700141_104,"Forget it. I don't understand, but it's important to save people!"
Dialog_Action_990700141_105,Uh...! Too slow! She's been taken away!
Dialog_Action_990700141_106,(Wasteland language) *#&@U! UWU! !! ##*@...￥*!
Dialog_Action_990700141_107,"How could this happen again! I couldn't save Rose, either!"
Dialog_Action_990700142_101,"Judging from the traces of these creatures, they should have been here."
Dialog_Action_990700142_102,(The faint cry of a little girl comes from afar)
Dialog_Action_990700142_103,Shoot! She's in danger! Quickly!
Dialog_Action_990700142_104,The monster has been slain by me. You can come out!
Dialog_Action_990700142_105,(Wasteland language)*&^^@!%#@%
Dialog_Action_990700142_106,"Sorry, I still don't understand what you are saying. But are you alright?"
Dialog_Action_990700142_107,"Sorry, now she's not. Are you also an outsider?"
Dialog_Action_990700142_108,(In surprise) You can understand what I say? Who are you!?
Dialog_Action_990700142_109,"Like you, I'm from another world! I advise you not to be curious! It is not easy to live in this world!"
Dialog_Action_990700142_110,Do not run!
Dialog_Action_990700143_101,This is... the forest. I didn't expect such a desolate world to have such a lush forest!
Dialog_Action_990700143_102,I didn't expect you could find it here. This place and this world are not in the same plane. It was taxing coming here.
Dialog_Action_990700143_103,Why did you kidnap the little girl!?
Dialog_Action_990700143_104,"This has nothing to do with you. If you have to intervene, then face my pet first!"
Dialog_Action_990700143_105,(Gasps) Huff... huff... a stray dog trying to stop me!?
Dialog_Action_990700143_106,"Look at yourself! I admire your courage. I'll spare you this time. Whether you want to take revenge or save the others, just come to me. But next time, I won't be so kind!"
Dialog_Action_990700144_101,How did she escape!? The monsters behind us are following too closely! I have to help them!
Dialog_Action_990700144_102,(Shouts in Wasteland language)*￥&@...#...￥&@&! !!
Dialog_Action_990700144_103,(Looks horrified) Q@#*
Dialog_Action_990700144_104,Don't be afraid! I'm coming! Run!
Dialog_Action_990700144_105,(Wasteland language)****%&@......￥...! !! !
Dialog_Action_990700144_106,Hang in there! I will finish this monster!
Dialog_Action_990700144_107,Problem solved!
Dialog_Action_990700144_108,(Tries to catch breath) &%...@...#...............!
Dialog_Action_990700144_109,My fault! I was late! I was too weak! Correct! That little girl!
Dialog_Action_990700144_110,"In reality, you are not weak. This monster is very powerful in this world. Killing it means you are absolutely extraordinary."
Dialog_Action_990700144_111,You drove them here on purpose!
Dialog_Action_990700144_112,"You wouldn't believe me even if I denied it. Say, how about we go back to that place and fight? If you win, I'll abandon the plan and return the little girl to you, but if you lose, then..."
Dialog_Action_990700144_113,I will not lose!
Dialog_Action_990700144_114,Heh... I hope so!
Dialog_Action_990700145_101,"Big Lion, here I am!"
Dialog_Action_990700145_102,"Oh, Big Lion. Forget it! Let me finish you with one blow!"
Dialog_Action_990700145_103,"Huff, huff... Big Lion, you lost!"
Dialog_Action_990700145_104,"(Touches the wound) Well. You're good. I'm a man of my word. Plan aborted, but this is just temporary. You can take back the little girl. Keep her safe, knowing I can come for her at any time!"
Dialog_Action_990700145_105,Humph! Suit yourself!
Dialog_Action_990700145_106,(Nervously) %&#&@...0_0....?
Dialog_Action_990700145_107,"Don't be afraid, I will take you to a safe place."
Dialog_Action_990700145_108,"Lil' Warrior, doesn't this feel familiar? Let's see what will happen next! Hahahahahahaha!"
Dialog_Action_990700146_101,This is the lair of monsters! Everyone move carefully.
Dialog_Action_990700146_102,Finally all cleaned up. Now the nearby settlements can live in peace.
Dialog_Action_990700146_103,We received a radio message from Sturges saying that the Starlight Drive-In was attacked!
Dialog_Action_990700146_104,"Damn, no breathing room at all? Or should I find a suitable person as a ""general"" to share the burden?"
Dialog_Action_990700147_101,"The Raider's stronghold is here, can we really trust you?"
Dialog_Action_990700147_102,"Don't worry, leave it to the Minutemen. We will definitely help you get the items back."
Dialog_Action_990700147_103,Then we can only rely on you. Please bring it back as it is the yield for the whole year.
Dialog_Action_990700147_104,"Go to a safe place first, and let us handle things here."
Dialog_Action_990700147_105,"Haha, with this amount of food I am sure we can splurge for a while."
Dialog_Action_990700147_106,That's it!
Dialog_Action_990700147_107,What's up? Who are you!?
Dialog_Action_990700147_108,"The Minutemen! Return all that you stole, and we'll spare your life!"
Dialog_Action_990700147_109,"No idea what you're talking about, but if you keep being nosey you will die!"
Dialog_Action_990700147_110,"You can get your things back, and don't worry about the Raiders harassing you."
Dialog_Action_990700147_111,The Minutemen... Really returned?
Dialog_Action_990700147_112,Yes! We have. The Minutemen will protect you.
Dialog_Action_990700148_101,This place is so big! Clock's ticking. We'll split up and find the mutants before they eat the kidnapped people.
Dialog_Action_990700148_102,"No problem. Let's go, Dogmeat."
Dialog_Action_990700148_103,Woof-woof!
Dialog_Action_990700148_104,"Help, I don't want to die here!"
Dialog_Action_990700148_105,Let him go!
Dialog_Action_990700148_106,"Sorry, I'm late!"
Dialog_Action_990700148_107,"Doesn't matter. It's been dealt with already. Thanks to you, possible casualties were avoided."
Dialog_Action_990700148_108,"It's okay. I don't have a clue where Shaun is, anyway."
Dialog_Action_990700148_109,Right. What do you say to being appointed as General of the Minutemen? And protecting the people?
Dialog_Action_990700148_110,I'd be happy to help.
Dialog_Action_990700149_101,"Scour this hospital. According to radio communications, the Dweller chased by the Gunners should have taken refuge in the hospital."
Dialog_Action_990700149_102,"Why would such trivial matters bring you here? Where's this ""General?”"
Dialog_Action_990700149_103,"He was sent on a mission to Tenpines Bluff, so I am in charge. Everyone split up and tread carefully!"
Dialog_Action_990700149_104,Finally found you. Come back with us.
Dialog_Action_990700149_105,"Well, you must be the new Minutemen recruit."
Dialog_Action_990700149_106,"No, I am the leader of the Minutemen."
Dialog_Action_990700149_107,"Oh, the leader of the Minutemen would carry out those dangerous missions himself?"
Dialog_Action_990700149_108,"Yes. Whatever the mission, it is our duty to protect the people."
Dialog_Action_990700150_101,"It is time the Raiders understood that the Minutemen have returned. Get revenge for our fallen comrades, and for the innocent people killed or injured!"
Dialog_Action_990700150_102,Revenge!
Dialog_Action_990700150_103,"(Walkie-talkie) Not good, boss! We are surrounded by the Minutemen. The losses are heavy."
Dialog_Action_990700150_104,Impossible! The Minutemen couldn't even take a blow back in Quincy. Something must be wrong! Go find out for me!
Dialog_Action_990700150_105,(Walkie-talkie) But... Ah. (Killed)
Dialog_Action_990700150_106,"No doubt, the Minutemen are back! You have to pay for it with your blood!"
Dialog_Action_990700150_107,It's you! Preston!? Fire!
Dialog_Action_990700150_108,"Sorry, there are still many Raiders that have broken through and run away."
Dialog_Action_990700150_109,Let that be a message that the Minutemen are back!
Dialog_Action_800400101_101,Right here? A city controlled by a group of Raiders?
Dialog_Action_800400101_102,We crashed here after we were shot down.
Dialog_Action_800400101_103,Look at the bells all over the place; these must be decorations for Christmas.
Dialog_Action_800400101_104,"Wow, if you collect all the Christmas Chariot decorations, you should be able to ask Santa Claus for more!"
Dialog_Action_800400101_105,"I'm afraid you will be disappointed. In any case, let's save this bonehead who is pretending to be Santa Claus."
Dialog_Action_800400101_106,Are these Raiders really preparing for Christmas!? They've got a lot of decorations.
Dialog_Action_800400101_107,"These cute little decorations were all ours! Now they have them! For Santa Claus, these are precious gems. As long as you bring back the snatched bells, we will definitely repay you."
Dialog_Action_800400101_108,That's something kids would do! Do you want us to pick up these bells while dodging bullets!?!
Dialog_Action_800400101_109,Can't you...
Dialog_Action_800400101_110,You gotta pay more.
Dialog_Action_800400104_111,"It's all over! You Christmas bell thieves! I am the representative of Santa Claus, and I want him back and these bells too!"
Dialog_Action_800400104_112,"What!? You jerks, the axeman has taken our gift bag, and you don't even leave us the holiday bells!?"
Dialog_Action_800400104_113,"What gift bag? Wait, Christmas? Are you really celebrating?"
Dialog_Action_800400104_114,Don't you try to spoil our Christmas. It's Christmas or death! I want to have a perfect Christmas with songs!
Dialog_Action_800400104_115,"Wh-what the heck happened to me... no, I can't remember... Except that a guy in a big red dress showed up... for Christmas... Christmas..."
Dialog_Action_800400104_116,I have a bad feeling about this... Something's wrong with this guy...
Dialog_Action_800400104_117,Santa Claus was captured by Dr. Kemp... Dr. Kemp with an axe... Ahh! This voice! This voice is haunting!
Dialog_Action_800400104_118,"With an axe... well, guys, bring your shotgun because you are gonna need it... Hey, do we need to wear earplugs too?"
Dialog_Action_800400105_101,Why are there so many Raiders in this city? It's like all the Raiders in Boston were here.
Dialog_Action_800400105_102,"Not ""were.” They are here."
Dialog_Action_800400105_103,What are they coming here for? Christmas chorus? Christmas preparations?
Dialog_Action_800400105_104,"No matter what, if they stand in our way, it will be Christmas next year by the time we get to the museum."
Dialog_Action_800400105_105,"The way I see it... if we can walk across the subway tracks, there should be no enemies there."
Dialog_Action_800400105_106,"Good idea, let's go to the subway station first."
Dialog_Action_800400106_107,"Good. We are in the subway station, but it looks like a Ghouls lair."
Dialog_Action_800400106_108,"Not ""were.” They are here. I must have been kicked in the head by that reindeer to believe your stupid idea!"
Dialog_Action_800400106_109,"Well, at the very least, there are less of them than the Raiders outside, and we can get to the museum after we clean them up."
Dialog_Action_800400106_110,Hope this subway tunnel is still intact.
Dialog_Action_800400107_111,(Pants) Alright. Alright. We will be there soon. It's like running a marathon!
Dialog_Action_800400107_112,"Not ""were.” They are here. We have a reindeer, too!? Why do we have to run so far!?"
Dialog_Action_800400107_113,I don't mind helping you if I have a sleigh...
Dialog_Action_800400107_114,We have never built a reindeer sleigh... but we will be there soon. The area beyond the sharp building is the museum.
Dialog_Action_800400107_115,Every single cell in my body is preventing me from approaching...
Dialog_Action_800400107_116,Think about that magical bag! There might be supplies we can use for Christmas next year!
Dialog_Action_800400107_117,It looks like you've convinced every single cell to go.
Dialog_Action_800400108_118,I think it makes sense for your cells to be scared. I feel like we are entering a horror film set where Christmas carols are used as the background music.
Dialog_Action_800400108_119,"Well, we are right in the scene... It's even scarier than Pickman's gallery."
Dialog_Action_800400108_120,Be careful! Raiders!
Dialog_Action_800400108_121,"Strangely, this group of Raiders doesn't seem to be fighting against us. They look like they have seen something terrible and are running for their lives."
Dialog_Action_800400108_122,"Not ""were.” They are here. I really hope that this reindeer gift is worthy of the pants I might have to change..."
Dialog_Action_800400108_123,Stop it! Raiders! There are Doom Slayers everywhere... What are you Marowski?!?!
Dialog_Action_800400108_124,"Ohhhh... Are you at this hotel for vacation? Yeah, yeah. All work and no play makes Marowski a dull boy. Christmas is about taking a good rest, looking for inspiration..."
Dialog_Action_800400108_125,"Which reminds me of a very bad scene... Let's hope there's not blood everywhere... Knock it off, Marowski. Give us the bag and the old man."
Dialog_Action_800400108_126,You don't want to stay in this hotel either?! Do you agree that I am a bum who cannot make money?
Dialog_Action_800400108_127,What are you talking about? Did you eat something you shouldn't have? No... Don't come over...
Dialog_Action_800400108_128,Marowski is here...
Dialog_Action_800400108_129,Oh... what's wrong with me... what happened?
Dialog_Action_800400108_130,Marowski?! !
Dialog_Action_800400108_131,I... I just remembered that I seem to be a writer with a lot of secrets... Hotel... Christmas... jingle bell... jingle bell...
Dialog_Action_800400108_132,"Earth to you, Marowski, tell us what happened."
Dialog_Action_800400108_133,"No... I really don't know, except that it's Christmas and I was on vacation in a hotel... writing a novel... No, why would I think so? Ah... Ah! This Christmas song keeps getting stuck in my head!"
Dialog_Action_800400108_134,"You gave me chills. The reindeer that looks like a human, the inexplicable movie characters, and the weird Christmas songs... What the heck is going on... Christmas, Christmas?"
Dialog_Action_800400108_135,"No... I don't know, I only remember that there was a factory, and I saw a guy in red there..."
Dialog_Action_800400108_136,That's Santa Claus! Take us to him!
Dialog_Action_800400109_101,Wow! Have you noticed that big Christmas tree in the city center!? Christmas carols came from over there!
Dialog_Action_800400109_102,"Yes, I can see it. Why are there horns all over the big Christmas tree..."
Dialog_Action_800400109_103,"These are all Santa Claus' masterpieces. Seeing this Christmas tree and listening to Christmas songs, everyone will feel the Christmas vibe!"
Dialog_Action_800400109_104,No wonder I feel like today is Christmas...
Dialog_Action_800400109_105,Isn't today Christmas?
Dialog_Action_800400109_106,"What a weird question. Of course it is Christmas. Listen, isn't this a Christmas song?"
Dialog_Action_800400109_107,Christmas... Christmas... Yes! We must rescue Santa Claus...
Dialog_Action_800400109_108,"Santa Claus is not here, but we found a cassette. Let's listen to it."
Dialog_Action_800400109_109,"Santa Claus! You are dead for sure! I am Dr. Kemp, the Krampus of Christmas! I'm taking away your gifts, and your children's gifts too!"
Dialog_Action_800400109_110,"Help! Help! Somebody, reindeer or whomever, come to the school outside the city and save me!"
Dialog_Action_800400109_111,"It seems that we still need to take the subway once more. Although there are many ghouls, we must rescue Santa Claus."
Dialog_Action_800400109_112,Exactly! Christmas! Christmas!
Dialog_Action_800400112_113,"This is the school where Santa Claus is being kept. Hold on, why are there so many Gunners!?"
Dialog_Action_800400112_114,Christmas... Christmas... Take all the gifts. Don't you want to take our gifts!
Dialog_Action_800400112_115,They are rushing over!
Dialog_Action_800400112_116,There. We have finished them... what's wrong with you?
Dialog_Action_800400112_117,I saw this electronic screen...
Dialog_Action_800400112_118,What's with the electronic screen...
Dialog_Action_800400112_119,Take a good look...
Dialog_Action_800400112_120,"It says ""Today is December 15..."" Why?"
Dialog_Action_800400112_121,Christmas... Christmas... Christmas... Isn't it Christmas today?
Dialog_Action_800400112_122,"Of course, today is Christmas... No... No... I feel something is wrong... But... But where..."
Dialog_Action_800400112_123,Christmas...Christmas...Christmas...25...25th...December...25th...
Dialog_Action_800400112_124,"Yup! Christmas is December 25th, and today should not be Christmas!"
Dialog_Action_800400112_125,You're right! I... what's wrong with me... it's obviously not Christmas today! Santa Claus! He must know something! We need to find him!!!
Dialog_Action_800400112_126,Correct! Everything is so weird! Reindeer! Come and explain!
Dialog_Action_800400112_127,What's wrong?
Dialog_Action_800400112_128,"Today is not Christmas, and you are not a Reindeer at all! What the heck is going on!?"
Dialog_Action_800400112_129,"No!!!! Today is Christmas! Guests will come from all directions, and the turnover this time of the year will be doubled several times! Everyone will eat a big meal, buy stuff and go home! Today is Christmas!"
Dialog_Action_800400112_130,"No, the reindeer ran away. Ahhhh, this Christmas song keeps playing over and over and is driving me crazy. Take this piece of cotton and plug your ears."
Dialog_Action_800400112_131,Dave?! Wh-what are you doing? What's with the hat on your head?
Dialog_Action_800400112_132,Can't you see it? This is the Christmas hat that Jessica gave me! I'm teaching people in the Republic of Dave how to celebrate Christmas!
Dialog_Action_800400112_133,"Today is not Christmas, and Christmas hats are not green either!"
Dialog_Action_800400112_134,Shut up! Rude. How dare you talk bad about the great Christmas and Dave wearing the Christmas hat! I'm gonna make you into my Christmas dinner!
Dialog_Action_800400112_135,It seems that I can't talk any sense into them. Let's try another way.
Dialog_Action_800400112_136,"My God, why am I here?! Who put this hat on me?"
Dialog_Action_800400112_137,"Calm down, Dave, you may not believe it, but you put it on yourself."
Dialog_Action_800400112_138,(Everyone explains)
Dialog_Action_800400112_139,"It's weird... Why would I celebrate Christmas... No, Christmas... What is it?"
Dialog_Action_800400112_140,"Sure enough, everyone is weird. There's a big problem with this city. We must find out the problem."
Dialog_Action_800400112_141,"Then I think you should go to the catacombs. I vaguely remember, I was operating some sort of apparatus there..."
Dialog_Action_800400113_101,"Well, after we leave school, we should always remind ourselves that today is not Christmas. The earplugs. Don't take them off and listen to the song."
Dialog_Action_800400113_102,Today is not Christmas... Today is not Christmas... Today is not Christmas...
Dialog_Action_800400113_103,"Very well, today is not Christmas... Today is not Christmas... Next, let's go to the catacombs and look around. There must be clues."
Dialog_Action_800400113_104,Today is not Christmas... Today is not Christmas... Today is not Christmas... Today is not Christmas...
Dialog_Action_800400113_105,Today is not Christmas... Today is not Christmas... Today is Christmas... No!
Dialog_Action_800400116_106,"Wow! Look at this tomb. It's not like a tomb at all, but a large server... No, it's like a radio station!"
Dialog_Action_800400116_107,"That's right. So many cables and devices. Sure enough, this is an evil conspiracy!"
Dialog_Action_800400116_108,But why does this guy play the same Christmas song over an over? Why would they want to make us think it's Christmas?
Dialog_Action_800400116_109,Maybe it is an evil businessman who wants to sell all the bells he can't sell!
Dialog_Action_800400116_110,That doesn't seem like a heinous crime...
Dialog_Action_800400116_111,Who said that!? I'm wiped out because of these bells! I have to punish him for the sake of my ears and waist!
Dialog_Action_800400116_112,"Okay, then. Down with him!"
Dialog_Action_800400116_113,"There is nothing but cables, cables, cables and a dead ghoul."
Dialog_Action_800400116_114,"Yes, but it is not that there's no other way around. Follow these cables and we will be able to find clues."
Dialog_Action_800400116_115,Look at where they lead... It's the city center...
Dialog_Action_800400116_116,There's a problem with the Christmas tree playing the Christmas song!!
Dialog_Action_800400119_101,Do you see that strange Christmas tree? Those cables are definitely not for powering the lights! We have to go to the top and find out!
Dialog_Action_800400119_102,"You are right, but there are obviously more Raiders here. They are all singing! There really is a problem with this Christmas song!"
Dialog_Action_800400119_103,"It's time to tell them that it's not Christmas today... Wait, the Christmas song is playing again! Put on earplugs quickly."
Dialog_Action_800400119_104,I wish these guys could be as nice as they are today.
Dialog_Action_800400120_105,"You see it? This is not a Christmas tree at all; it looks like some alien item! There are so many weird speakers, no wonder the sound travels so far."
Dialog_Action_800400120_106,"Yes, I get it now, he must be the one behind the scenes! I feel bad for wronging him at Marowski's."
Dialog_Action_800400120_107,"It seems that he used a high-frequency hertz that humans can't hear to brainwash everyone. These sounds are hidden in the Christmas carols, making everyone think that today is Christmas..."
Dialog_Action_800400120_108,Take the shotgun. We will soon find out the truth!
Dialog_Action_800400120_109,Stop it! Raider! Doom Slayers are everywhere!
Dialog_Action_800400120_110,"I am not a Raider, I am Dr. Kemp, the Krampus of Christmas!"
Dialog_Action_800400120_111,What did you say? !
Dialog_Action_800400120_112,"Didn't see that coming, huh!? The so-called ""Good Boy Corps!” I have captured Santa Claus! Bad boys have won tonight's battle!! I'm gonna destroy your sleigh!"
Dialog_Action_800400120_113,"Oh, my good kids, you have come to save me! Save me and defeat this demon!"
Dialog_Action_800400120_114,"No, could Browning's words be true? Christmas is why Santa Claus would fight with him?"
Dialog_Action_800400120_115,Certainly not... but I think there is a problem...
Dialog_Action_800400120_116,You mean...
Dialog_Action_800400120_117,"He is a Raider, right? He is not Dr. Kemp, which means..."
Dialog_Action_800400120_118,Raiders are also the victims!
Dialog_Action_800400120_119,"In other words, the real guy behind the scenes should be..."
Dialog_Action_800400120_120,Be careful! The Raiders are coming!
Dialog_Action_800400120_121,It's over... It's all over...
Dialog_Action_800400120_122,"No, it's not over yet! Santa Claus... wait, you are a robot!"
Dialog_Action_800400120_123,"Yes, I am a robot. I was a robot used to welcome customers at a department store on Christmas. I have waited for two hundred years, during which no one celebrated the holiday. This is wrong and I must remind everyone of Christmas."
Dialog_Action_800400120_124,"I built this tower, a tower that would remind everyone to celebrate Christmas. Everyone will imagine that they are part of Christmas. Wouldn't it be better for everyone to spend a never-ending Christmas happily together?"
Dialog_Action_800400120_125,But you didn't expect that the Raiders would imagine that they were Dr. Kemp and attack you...
Dialog_Action_800400120_126,"Although there is a slight deviation, the result is acceptable. Thank you for saving me with the help of Reindeer. Let's enjoy Christmas!"
Dialog_Action_800400120_127,"No, you are wrong. This hypocritical Christmas is not the real Christmas! We will stop you!"
Dialog_Action_800400120_128,"Shut up, you don't know more about Christmas than I do! Bells, Christmas trees, cookies, as long as you have these, it is Christmas! I have prepared for two hundred years, enough for everyone to celebrate Christmas for the rest of their lives!"
Dialog_Action_800400120_129,Christmas should be a time to have fun with your family. The Christmas decorations are not important. What really matters is that people care about each other. Christmas trees don't represent Christmas. It is only Christmas when everyone sits around the Christmas tree together.
Dialog_Action_800400120_130,It's not that the Christmas tree reminds people to have Christmas. The tree isn't even necessary.
Dialog_Action_800400120_131,So.... no one is celebrating..... because none of them have a family?
Dialog_Action_800400120_132,Not correct....the thought of people getting together of their own free will creates the Christmas atmosphere.
Dialog_Action_800400120_133,Invite... family... to celebrate Christmas together...
Dialog_Action_800400120_134,"You are right... Two hundred years have passed, and people need a Christmas... Maybe we can give this place a real Christmas tree, dress it up, and let everyone who sees this tree understand that Christmas is the time when they are gonna have fun with their friends and loved ones."
Dialog_Action_800400120_135,"You are right! Celebrate Christmas! Let's decorate this tree. You go collect some materials! I have a gift for you, one that I've kept for two hundred years!"
Dialog_Action_800400120_136,But this is a big tree! Do you want me to risk my life to climb all the way up and hang bells?! !
Dialog_Action_800400120_137,You mean...
Dialog_Action_800400120_138,I want more gifts.
Dialog_Action_990700151_1,"Desdemona! Get out of here! The Institute discovered this place. By now, they should already be inside. Hurry up and escape!"
Dialog_Action_990700151_2,What!? The Institute actually found this place?! What about Carrington?
Dialog_Action_990700151_3,"Let's pray for them, but the Institute Synths have already discovered this secret tunnel and will soon show up, we need to get a move on!"
Dialog_Action_990700151_4,"I can't let them be captured! Deacon, go to the safe house first. I'm going to save them!"
Dialog_Action_990700151_5,Then I...
Dialog_Action_990700151_6,"No, the Railroad must remain strong. You go to the Safe House right now! I cannot accept my comrades in arms dying before me. I will inherit their will and avenge them!"
Dialog_Action_990700151_7,...Then good luck to you. Good luck to the Railroad! The Institute should know how scary a livid Desdemona can be...
Dialog_Action_990700152_1,(Radio) Carrington! Are you all right? I'm here to save you!
Dialog_Action_990700152_2,"(Radio) Thanks to you, we are all okay. We shut ourselves in the panic room, but there are those tin cans outside, and that stupid Tom didn't put any weapons in the panic room!"
Dialog_Action_990700152_3,(Radio) It's good that you are alive. Stay there. I will save you!
Dialog_Action_990700152_4,"No... I can't go back all alone, I need to rescue some companions to help me to get into the deepest parts."
Dialog_Action_990700152_5,Hostile targets found!
Dialog_Action_990700152_6,"Ha, you are just a bunch of tin cans!"
Dialog_Action_990700152_7,Calling for support...
Dialog_Action_990700152_8,Shoot! He called for more Coursers!
Dialog_Action_990700152_9,But... it should be possible to take away its memory reading device. This thing will tell me the route and location of his companions...
Dialog_Action_990700153_1,"My, Desdemona, you saved us! You're much better than that loser Tom!"
Dialog_Action_990700153_2,"Aside from that, we've got Synths everywhere in the base. And the Coursers are on their way."
Dialog_Action_990700153_3,"But I got this memory reading device from a Courser I just wiped out. Tom, do you have a way to use it?"
Dialog_Action_990700153_4,"Oh! You actually got it. This is a treasure... well, all done. I have cracked it, and you can see the location of all his companions."
Dialog_Action_990700153_5,You are not useless after all!
Dialog_Action_990700153_6,"Alright, send someone forward with me and the rest stay behind. I've found a unique but safe path."
Dialog_Action_990700154_1,Bad news! There are voices behind us. They are catching up!
Dialog_Action_990700154_2,Sheesh! I forgot to block the signal of the memory reader in our hand!
Dialog_Action_990700154_3,"You mean... we can see them, and they can see us?"
Dialog_Action_990700154_4,"Tom, you moron. You bloody moron!"
Dialog_Action_990700154_5,"This is not the time to fight, they've surrounded us. Let's break through before there are too many of them!"
Dialog_Action_990700154_6,"Hostile targets found! The Institute has an order for you. Lay down your weapons, join the Institute, and make a report on the escaped Synths. Then the Institute will spare you."
Dialog_Action_990700154_7,"Bah! A robot is actually trying to get us to give up! Human beings always pursue equality and freedom, even if they have to die for it! The Railroad will never succumb to you!"
Dialog_Action_990700155_1,"Okay, a safe exit up ahead. Go."
Dialog_Action_990700155_2,What about you?
Dialog_Action_990700155_3,"The Institute has killed so many of my companions, I can't run away like a rat. They think they are the hunter, but I'm gonna let them know who the prey really is."
Dialog_Action_990700155_4,"It's too dangerous here. Where there is life, there is hope. Don't be stupid!"
Dialog_Action_990700155_5,I'm not being stupid. I have to rescue more people. I will rebuild the Railroad.
Dialog_Action_990700155_6,"Well, I know I can't persuade you, but you must be careful."
Dialog_Action_990700155_7,"You didn't expect that I would come back eh, tin can!"
Dialog_Action_990700155_8,Hostile targets found. Attack!
Dialog_Action_990700155_9,"The Institute must pay today, and you are our bounty!"
Dialog_Action_990700155_10,Stupid Institute. Don't they understand they are facing humans?
Dialog_Action_990700155_11,"The pursuit of freedom is engraved in our bones, and the bullets of the Coursers can never destroy it."
Dialog_Action_990700155_12,"They think that creating Synths can eliminate humans, but this is as stupid as building a house with straw."
Dialog_Action_990700155_13,"As long as there is a wind, freedom can start a grand fire."
Dialog_Action_990700156_1,"Ahhh! Those cowards, those dirtbags, those profit-seeking jerks!"
Dialog_Action_990700156_2,"We fought side by side and built this kingdom together, but now they are coming to take the throne!"
Dialog_Action_990700156_3,They would actually ask me to open the election and let everyone vote! Could this change the fact that Dave's rule is respected?
Dialog_Action_990700156_4,"Pathetic, your eyes are blinded by power. Power is just a flash in the pan. I don't care about it! Yet they would still hire men to guard these votes?"
Dialog_Action_990700156_5,"I believe that the people can make the right choice. However, I will first ask Stealth Boy to check these votes lest the people should be deceived and make the wrong choice."
Dialog_Action_990700156_6,"No matter what you think, I can't accept such a lunatic running this place."
Dialog_Action_990700156_7,And so? Are you going to bring him down? Dave is not an obedient person.
Dialog_Action_990700156_8,"It doesn't matter. Let's just keep an eye on him for now and after he fails if he leaves, great, if not...."
Dialog_Action_990700156_9,You are gonna...
Dialog_Action_990700156_10,"Yes, if I steal ""Ol'Painless"" he can't do anything then, and I'll throw him into the wild to become food for the Deathclaws."
Dialog_Action_990700156_11,Ahhh! Despicable traitors!! !
Dialog_Action_990700156_12,My kindness was exchanged for such a shameless betrayal! How am I gonna live with this? I must kill all these traitors! I'll get my gun back first... then my votes!
Dialog_Action_990700157_1,"Oh, my dear friends, so this is who you stick with after leaving me."
Dialog_Action_990700157_2,"As your friend, I should scourge these lousy people around you to ensure you do not get mixed up with them."
Dialog_Action_990700157_3,"But they seem to have found a tough person and I don't have my favorite gun... That said, wise Dave has prepared a secret weapon in advance. He's gonna get the key first."
Dialog_Action_990700157_4,"Now, where did you hide my gun and my votes!?"
Dialog_Action_990700157_5,There! There! All in this note! I have marked it for you! It's just pay-to-work. Don't kill me!
Dialog_Action_990700157_6,Of course I can't kill you. This is a civilized city. You can only be convicted after the jury and the judge decides.
Dialog_Action_990700157_7,Really... When will the trial begin? Can I hire a lawyer?
Dialog_Action_990700157_8,"It begins now. I am the judge, lawyer, and jury. Now I will sentence you to death for assaulting others!"
Dialog_Action_990700157_9,Eh!?!!
Dialog_Action_990700157_10,"Aww, there are just too few fair and just leaders like me in this world."
Dialog_Action_990700158_1,"Okay, Dwellers, Dave is here to collect votes. I believe that bullets can move people's hearts more than words, so I won't say much."
Dialog_Action_990700158_2,Let me look at this notebook and see where these thieves have hidden the votes.
Dialog_Action_990700158_3,"It seems that my bullets are really good at speaking, no one understands elections better than them."
Dialog_Action_990700158_4,"So, the votes are almost there. Next I'm gonna get my favorite gun back..."
Dialog_Action_990700159_1,"It seems that in their hearts, my gun is more terrifying than the ballot. There are so many people around..."
Dialog_Action_990700159_2,But that's no big deal. The notebook shows that a Stealth Boy will be here. These Raiders don't even know that I have arrived.
Dialog_Action_990700159_3,"Ahahaha, there is nothing more joyful than recovering what's lost!"
Dialog_Action_990700159_4,"Had it not been lost, I might not have known that I could love a gun so much."
Dialog_Action_990700159_5,"Well, now the judge, lawyer and jury have assembled, the executioner is also in place."
Dialog_Action_990700159_6,It's time to bring the bad guys to justice.
Dialog_Action_990700160_1,"Listen to the erratic footsteps, they are in a state of panic."
Dialog_Action_990700160_2,Votes! Dave is here to get the final votes!
Dialog_Action_990700160_3,"My friends, look at you. You are pathetic."
Dialog_Action_990700160_4,I couldn't help but recollect the thrilling moments we had. I'm getting emotional now.
Dialog_Action_990700160_5,"Of course, you don't need to be nervous. I'm a civilized man."
Dialog_Action_990700160_6,"Wrathful as I am, I won't casually kill people. Fair judgement must be applied."
Dialog_Action_990700160_7,"Now, as the ""lawyer, judge, jury and executioner,” I will sentence you to death!"
Dialog_Action_990700161_1,Wake up... Wake. Up.
Dialog_Action_990700161_2,Ngh... Who's there?
Dialog_Action_990700161_3,It doesn't matter who I am. Worry about who you are and what you desire. Think about it now...
Dialog_Action_990700161_4,Ahhh! I can't. I don't want to. I'm so mad. I want to fight. I want to rip and tear!
Dialog_Action_990700161_5,"Excellent... You were born to fight the Doom Slayer, the most powerful warrior alive. Now, put on your helmet."
Dialog_Action_990700161_6,"YES! I remember. I remember it all... Doom Slayer, Doom Slayer, I must kill him!"
Dialog_Action_990700162_1,"Come, Raider. Here is the arena, specially prepared for you. Let's see if you can slay the Slayer!"
Dialog_Action_990700162_2,"Ahhh! Although I don't know who you are, the warm-up you've prepared for me is quite interesting!"
Dialog_Action_990700163_1,"How amazing, Raider, your strength is stunning. Those weaklings were just a warm-up for you."
Dialog_Action_990700163_2,Not enough. Not enough! Let me kill the Doom Slayer!
Dialog_Action_990700163_3,That depends on whether you are strong enough. Let's first see if you can defeat these powerful fighters.
Dialog_Action_990700164_1,Ahhh! I'm tired of these boring insects! You can't give me the fight I want!
Dialog_Action_990700164_2,"Raider, what are you doing!?"
Dialog_Action_990700164_3,You can't shut me down. I'm going to kill the Doom Slayer! I can feel his presence. He is here!
Dialog_Action_990700164_4,"Quick, send our most elite troops to stop him!"
Dialog_Action_990700165_1,"Yes, I can! I can feel it! The Doom Slayer is near! He is over there! Rip and tear! Uraaaaah!"
Dialog_Action_990700165_2,"Another bunch of moths, flying to the fire. You seek your own death!"
Dialog_Action_990700165_3,"Very good, it looks like our fighters are doing well in the testing phase."
Dialog_Action_990700165_4,"Yes, he defeated the virtual Doom Slayer we created, he should be able to face the real Doom Slayer."
Dialog_Action_990700165_5,"Then let him. No doubt, the Doom Slayer knows not the kind of monster he will face..."
Dialog_Action_990700166_1,What you are looking for is here. ~ A good friend of yours.
Dialog_Action_990700166_2,Dawnbreaker is here... I have to get the sword back.
Dialog_Action_990700166_3,But there are thieves coming this way.
Dialog_Action_990700166_4,I pray they haven't found the sword before I do...
Dialog_Action_990700166_5,"It matters not. They are simple minions, no match for me!"
Dialog_Action_990700167_1,Their numbers are increasing. A frontal attack would be a folly.
Dialog_Action_990700167_2,Maybe this rope will allow me to slip by...
Dialog_Action_990700167_3,They are multiplying.It appears they have found something... Could it be Dawnbreaker?
Dialog_Action_990700167_4,"Fools, they know not the value of Dawnbreaker. What's the use of taking the sword?"
Dialog_Action_990700167_5,Blindly attacking will cause alarm amongst the rabble. They can't be allowed to take away the sword... Seems it's time for a night raid.
Dialog_Action_990700168_1,"These weaklings are blind in the dark, they won't find me as long as I don't get close to them."
Dialog_Action_990700168_2,"But I can't see too far, so I must remain careful."
Dialog_Action_990700168_3,"Although these fools can't stop me, I'll be in trouble if I get caught."
Dialog_Action_990700169_1,So many enemies here...
Dialog_Action_990700169_2,"But I didn't feel Dawnbreaker... If there is nothing here, what are they guarding?"
Dialog_Action_990700169_3,"Maybe... they're not guarding anything, but waiting for someone?"
Dialog_Action_990700169_4,"A trap...? No matter, I'm about to reach the position stated in the letter, I'll find out very soon."
Dialog_Action_990700170_1,"It's a whole new world here, like a maze."
Dialog_Action_990700170_2,"For treasure collectors, hiding treasures in such a place is truly safe."
Dialog_Action_990700170_3,"But for hunters, this is also the best choice for an ambush."
Dialog_Action_990700170_4,"I must stay smart and flexible, make the best use of everything at hand."
Dialog_Action_990700170_5,"Hand over the sword slowly, and I'll allow you to leave."
Dialog_Action_990700170_6,"Hah! This guy fell for it! Maybe it's luck that kept you alive till now, but you won't leave this room!"
Dialog_Action_990700170_7,"A trap, as expected..."
Dialog_Action_990700170_8,"Although Dawnbreaker has not been retrieved, there's something else I've found..."
Dialog_Action_990700170_9,"Even in this world, someone still wants to kill me, and he knows me well. He knows everything."
Dialog_Action_990700170_10,"I thought I was in the shadows, but I didn't expect anyone to reside in a darker place."
Dialog_Action_990700170_11,No... I'm totally new here. I need to find some decent warriors to fight with...
Dialog_Action_990700171_1,Well... What the hell is this place...
Dialog_Action_990700171_2,What a mistake! I accidentally triggered the Teleportation Circle when I was exploring a tumulus. Now where am I?
Dialog_Action_990700171_3,My bag... my documents... I lost them...
Dialog_Action_990700171_4,(The growls of Radiated Mongrels can be heard)
Dialog_Action_990700171_5,Wowah! What kind of monster is this?! Dogs! I hate dogs! Staff... staff... where is my magic staff?!
Dialog_Action_990700171_6,Diary: [One slip and you lose it all. I never saw it coming that I made such a stupid mistake. I was teleported to an unfamiliar place. ]
Dialog_Action_990700171_7,"Diary: [My investigation told me that the Teleportation Circle teleported not only the tomb raiders, but the whole mountain where the tumulus was to here. ]"
Dialog_Action_990700171_8,Diary: [This is an evil land filled with vicious mongrels. I haven't found a friendly being so far. I can't just sit here and wait. I must find a way off the mountain. ]
Dialog_Action_990700172_1,Hoo... hoo... hoo...
Dialog_Action_990700172_2,Woof!
Dialog_Action_990700172_3,Oh no... there are wild beasts all over the mountain. I'll surely be dead if I don't get rescued.
Dialog_Action_990700172_4,Woof woof!
Dialog_Action_990700172_5,Stay away from me!
Dialog_Action_990700172_9,Wowah! What is this? A talking cat? !
Dialog_Action_990700172_10,"I'm people! Never mind, save me first!"
Dialog_Action_990700172_11,Well... uh... miss? Could you please explain a lit... Is this because of radiation?
Dialog_Action_990700172_12,"What radiation? I was born this way! I am a Khajiit scholar coming here to investigate the tumulus. I triggered a trap by mistake, and ended up here!"
Dialog_Action_990700172_13,Which means you know why this mountain is here? That's wonderful. I will escort you to our camp. We need more information about this mountain.
Dialog_Action_990700172_6,"Diary: [Today is the second day since I woke up. All praises to the great Masser and Secunda. I also need to thank those Vault people too. Thanks to those people saving me in this forest, I am currently safe. ]"
Dialog_Action_990700172_7,"Diary: [It's hard to believe that the whole mountain was teleported to this world, but it happened. And the people here want the mountain to go back. ]"
Dialog_Action_990700172_8,Diary: [I am no expert in attack magic. I need to rely on the Vault people to be effective. I should go to their camp to see if there are mercenaries for me to hire. ]
Dialog_Action_990700173_1,"To be honest, I still don't buy your words. You said that you were a magical being from another world?"
Dialog_Action_990700173_2,"Yes. I hate to admit it, but it seems to me that I have indeed come to your world."
Dialog_Action_990700173_3,Well. I guess only magic can explain the traveling to another world...
Dialog_Action_990700173_4,I need you Vault people's help! I have lost everything in the earthquake caused by this teleportation. I cannot teleport the mountain back with my book. I need to find it.
Dialog_Action_990700173_5,"So it was you who caused the Capital Wasteland abnormity... Alright, let's go back to the camp and talk to the overseer..."
Dialog_Action_990700173_6,Grrrowl!
Dialog_Action_990700173_7,Oh no!
Dialog_Action_990700173_8,Wowah! Big lizard!
Dialog_Action_990700173_9,"Calm down, miss. It's just a deathclaw... Hmm, but it's not coming at us."
Dialog_Action_990700173_10,Thanks to the great Masser and Secunda... Your world is too dangerous.
Dialog_Action_990700173_11,"It's still in our way now. We need to get rid of it. Miss, can you fight?"
Dialog_Action_990700173_12,"I'm not good at magic attack, but I can support behind you."
Dialog_Action_990700173_13,"That's enough. Let's finish it, and get back to the camp."
Dialog_Action_990700173_18,"Diary: [Although the shock robbed me of speech at the beginning, now I have accepted the reality. The whole mountain and I were teleported to this place called Capital Wasteland, which is plagued by ""Radiation"". ]"
Dialog_Action_990700173_19,"Diary: [They said that they had a temporary camp. But I would rather call it ""Mercenary Point"". Because that place is similar to Tamriel Guild. The ""Vault"" warriors are waiting for their quests with their fire-breathing staffs. And when I bring out the gold coins, I get all of their attentions. ]"
Dialog_Action_990700173_20,"Diary: [I talked to the leader who they called the ""Overseer"" and explained about the issues. It turned out that the place they called Mount Mabel was gone. It seems like they were teleported to Tamriel. ]"
Dialog_Action_990700173_21,"Diary: [It seems like something in the tumulus started some troubles to this land. The Vault mercenaries were talking about the solution, and I took this opportunity to offer my suggestion. ]"
Dialog_Action_990700173_22,"Diary: [I hired them to retrieve my lost stuff. As a return, I need to figure out how to make this mountain back to Tamriel. It's just that ...... I have no idea what's destroying this land. ]"
Dialog_Action_990700173_23,Diary: [May Masser and Secunda bless me...Hope it's not a dragon that was also teleported here. ]
Dialog_Action_990700174_1,"Let me reassert, overseer wants us to assist this lady to teleport this mountain back. Understand?"
Dialog_Action_990700174_2,I knew every single word your said. But I still couldn't believe it. What is magic? Nord? It's just unbelievable.
Dialog_Action_990700174_3,"Then take a look at the lady's tail. If there is not a land of magic, why would she became like this?"
Dialog_Action_990700174_4,I feel like being offended.
Dialog_Action_990700174_5,"Oh! I am very sorry, miss. But what we have here are totally different from your world. Please excuse my suspicion."
Dialog_Action_990700174_6,"Sure. But it's very complicated for me to explain. You mercenaries should just protect me, and help me find my lost items and books."
Dialog_Action_990700174_7,I like the mercenary title. Sounds cool.
Dialog_Action_990700174_8,But mercenaries should be paid! I don't see any cap here!
Dialog_Action_990700174_9,I have paid you gold coins! Oh wait! Look!
Dialog_Action_990700174_10,It's getting dark soon. Don't get lost!
Dialog_Action_990700174_11,Diary: [Good news today. I found a piece of my bag on a tree. ]
Dialog_Action_990700174_12,Diary: [Perhaps I was too excited. I forgot that humans couldn't see at night and they needed to sleep. ]
Dialog_Action_990700174_13,Diary: [Therefore I went out alone. They probably couldn't find me. ]
Dialog_Action_990700174_14,"Diary: [Right now, I am shivering in an abandoned wooden hut. I can hear heavy breathing from outside. I hope that my mercenary can come and save me...]"
Dialog_Action_990700175_1,"Mercenaries, look! Look at those mongrels! That is my bag them surrounded. My documents were in that bag!"
Dialog_Action_990700175_2,"Oh! Finally we found some clue, go! Let's get this bag back!"
Dialog_Action_990700175_3,They ran away. Go after them!
Dialog_Action_990700175_4,(Out of breath) Isn't it too much to ask me chase a dog?! It's impossible... But they can't be far. Let's go track them down then.
Dialog_Action_990700175_5,"Wait! Look, smoke over there!"
Dialog_Action_990700175_6,Wait! I remember that place. It's a village at the foot of  the mountain. I didn't know that they managed to survive!
Dialog_Action_990700175_7,"In the case, I might be able out get something from Tamriel from them."
Dialog_Action_990700176_1,"Miss, I have a good news and a bad news. Which one would you like to hear first?"
Dialog_Action_990700176_2,Good news.
Dialog_Action_990700176_3,The good news is that we found out that the mongrel who took you bag was killed.
Dialog_Action_990700176_4,Is that true?! Then we can just go take my books now. What about the bad news?
Dialog_Action_990700176_5,The bad news is that it was a Deathclaw who killed it. That monster is even more terrifying than others. It has dragged both the mongrel's corpse and your bag into its den.
Dialog_Action_990700176_6,......But I must get my books.
Dialog_Action_990700176_7,"......Actually, some of your books have scattered out. It's pretty easy to retrieve those. How about we just wrap it up here..."
Dialog_Action_990700176_8,No way! I need all of them! That's what I paid you the gold coins for! I can hire more mercenaries!
Dialog_Action_990700176_9,It's not about the money!
Dialog_Action_990700176_10,Double coins!
Dialog_Action_990700176_11,Ready at your service!
Dialog_Action_990700176_12,Hah! I found my exploration note. Now I can locate the rest of my books with it!
Dialog_Action_990700177_1,Okay. We have entered Deathclaw's Den now. Take a deep breath. Don't panic. It's just some Deathclaws. We can deal with them.
Dialog_Action_990700177_2,"Be careful, and don't ruin my books!"
Dialog_Action_990700177_3,Quite a nagging employer you are... We will try our best.
Dialog_Action_990700177_4,Let me take a look at my note. I'll see where this monster took my stuff.
Dialog_Action_990700177_5,Wowah! Two deathclaws! Somehow they seem to get bigger inside the den?!
Dialog_Action_990700177_6,Seem? They are indeed bigger than the normal one! Watch out! Watch out! They are coming this way!
Dialog_Action_990700177_7,"Okay... Phew... Phew... Miss. We have found your stuff. I swear the scratch mark on the book was from the deathclaw, not me!"
Dialog_Action_990700177_8,"Very well! You are indeed the best mercenaries I have ever seen! With all my books, I can find a way to restart the Teleportation Circle before long! Now let's head back. I need to check on the books."
Dialog_Action_990700177_9,I need to get another pants.
Dialog_Action_990700177_10,"Wait. Actually, I don't feel right. These Deathclaws usually won't just hide inside the den. They are predator, but they were afraid of going out..."
Dialog_Action_990700177_11,You are right... Now that you mentioned it... the monsters we have seen along the way were pretty scared of something. They only attacked us because we were in their way.
Dialog_Action_990700177_12,I thought they were scared off by the Deathclaws. But even the deathclaws were so afraid. What is going on behind it?
Dialog_Action_990700177_13,You are scaring me now. Let's report it to the headquarters first.
Dialog_Action_990700178_1,Thank you all for your help. The books have been retrieved. Let's see if I can find the information related to this tumulus.
Dialog_Action_990700178_2,You'd better be quick. Our people found out that the Enclave people are approaching towards us. They must be out there to investigate.
Dialog_Action_990700178_3,"Well, I have an idea actually. If it is a mysterious teleportation magic that sent us here, then this magic must still be here. Perhaps we can get teleported back by slightly changing it."
Dialog_Action_990700178_4,"...... Sorry, I can't understand your magic. But are you sure that it is possible?"
Dialog_Action_990700178_5,"Alright. Magic is continually moving forward. At the very beginning, magic wasn't that convenient. But people constantly develop magic and put them in the magic books. Although changing the magic might cause magic clash leading to the breakdown, it still works if we do it moderately."
Dialog_Action_990700178_6,Looks like we have no choice but to trust you on this.
Dialog_Action_990700178_7,"In the case, I need a Teleportation Circle. Have you seen three pillars here? That should be part of the circle. One is in the forest, one in the wetland under the mountain, and the last one on the hill."
Dialog_Action_990700178_8,"Then, should we go to the wetland? Unfortunately, that place has been captured by the Enclave."
Dialog_Action_990700178_9,The Enclave? You don't get along well?
Dialog_Action_990700178_10,"You can put it like that. Enclave people adopted a policy deeming it the sole remaining bastion of ""pure,"" mutation-free humanity on Earth. If they see you, they would take you as some mutant and wouldn't hesitate to kill you."
Dialog_Action_990700178_11,"Okay, seems like I still need to hire you Vault people to fight against them."
Dialog_Action_990700179_1,We found a highland that is suitable to be a campsite ahead. But it seems that Enclave people have  already taken the place.
Dialog_Action_990700179_2,"Before we carry out the next search, we must capture this highland. Otherwise, I can't find the location of the stone pillars."
Dialog_Action_990700179_3,"Then let's ""borrow"" their camp... I need a pair of clean shoes by the way."
Dialog_Action_990700179_4,Let me see... Hmm... it's over there! But it seems like Enclave people have already found that place.
Dialog_Action_990700179_5,I really hope that you have a way to bring this mountain back.
Dialog_Action_990700179_6,"Relax. Magic is omnipotent. If there is a need, there is a way to realize it."
Dialog_Action_990700179_7,It seems really convenient... Wonder if we can find some convenient stuff here.
Dialog_Action_990700179_8,I think somebody must be working on it. Okay. We need to clear this camp. I also need to enhance the gear at hands.
Dialog_Action_990700180_1,Look! The Enclave people are trying to steal the artifacts of the Nord Tumulus! Stop!
Dialog_Action_990700180_2,"Stop, miss! Enclave people aren't someone you can reason with!"
Dialog_Action_990700180_3,What is this? A new kind of mutant? ! Capture her!
Dialog_Action_990700180_4,"Now you know what kind of people the Enclave are, miss?"
Dialog_Action_990700180_5,"Those humans are nothing but a group of tomb raiders! They are here to go after the invaluable Nord artifacts! If I found anyone trying to steal anything here, I will curse them to grow a long cat tail!"
Dialog_Action_990700180_6,"(Quietly throws away the artifacts from the pocket) Miss, aren't you the first one who ventured into this tumulus?"
Dialog_Action_990700180_7,I am a scholar! I was doing a research! This is a matter of study!
Dialog_Action_990700180_8,"(Quietly throws away the artifacts from the pocket) Ok, ok. We understand."
Dialog_Action_990700180_9,"Seems like a few Nord artifacts have scattered in the swamp. If it is possible, I want them back!"
Dialog_Action_990700180_10,"Miss! It's absolutely not safe to go into the swamp. It's not just mud that we need to worry about, but also the Mirelurks! There must be Mirelurks here!"
Dialog_Action_990700180_11,This is why I hire you!
Dialog_Action_990700181_1,I have studied all of these artifacts. It seems like it must be a great ancient Nord who was buried here.
Dialog_Action_990700181_2,Oh? But why would someone set up a teleportation magic for his own tumulus?
Dialog_Action_990700181_3,It's actually not hard to understand. The magic can protect the tumulus from the tomb raiders by teleporting them away.
Dialog_Action_990700181_4,"But that obviously doesn't make sense, right?! Why would anyone want to teleport his own tumulus?"
Dialog_Action_990700181_5,"Well... we still need to further investigate... But thanks to the fact that this mountain is teleported away, these structures buried by snow are now unraveled. From what I have seen so far, this place must be a barrack."
Dialog_Action_990700181_6,So he was a general?
Dialog_Action_990700181_7,"No, a general don't deserve such a grand tumulus! This person's status must be even higher..."
Dialog_Action_990700181_8,(Secretly puts one piece of artifacts into the pocket) So the burial artifacts must be really valuable?
Dialog_Action_990700181_9,Yes indeed. But this person must be really careful of his own tumulus. He probably had cast some curse upon some things.
Dialog_Action_990700181_10,(Secretly throws away the artifact from the pocket) That's so vindictive!
Dialog_Action_990700181_11,"Diary: [Thanks to this strange teleportation, the snow on the mountain has melted. This land has become a swamp and the tumulus buried under the snow has been unraveled]"
Dialog_Action_990700181_12,"Diary: [I don't know what the Vault people think of the Nords. Therefore, I didn't tell them the whole truth. ]"
Dialog_Action_990700181_13,"Diary: [This tumulus belongs to a traitor of Nord. This person was not content to be under the rule of the emperor. He attempted a coup, but he passed away before he could start chaos. However, his people didn't give up. They were waiting for the day to bring back their lord. ]"
Dialog_Action_990700181_14,Diary: [And this Teleportation Circle must be the method for them to prevent the tumulus from being destroyed. I can tell that those people who were loyal to him had been living here for a long time. But they all have gone in the end... What on earth have happened? ]
Dialog_Action_990700181_15,Diary: [The documents aren't complete. I need to find more artifacts engraved with texts. ]
Dialog_Action_990700182_1,"Okay. Before we go to that tower, we must find the artifacts nearby."
Dialog_Action_990700182_2,"I think you probably have already forgotten your first goal! We are here to find a solution to move the mountain back, not playing archaeologist game with you!"
Dialog_Action_990700182_3,"If there is no other information, I can't find a way to restart the Teleportation Circle. Therefore, we must find the artifacts with texts engraving!"
Dialog_Action_990700182_4,"Alright, but one more thing! We want a share! We can't do this for free! Do you see how badly my leg was hurt because of those Mirelurks?"
Dialog_Action_990700182_5,"......Okay, you can take some of the artifacts without the texts. But never the one with texts!"
Dialog_Action_990700182_6,(Lets out a sign of relief and takes out a pile of artifacts) Let me see which one got texts.
Dialog_Action_990700182_7,"(Lets out a sign of relief and takes out a pile of artifacts) Yeah, let me see too."
Dialog_Action_990700182_8,......Did I hire the wrong people?
Dialog_Action_990700183_1,We are very close to that place now.
Dialog_Action_990700183_2,"Which means, we have ventured deep into the Enclave  camp. We can't possibly avoid the conflict with the Enclave now."
Dialog_Action_990700183_3,Look over there! Those villagers of Tamriel are captured by the Enclave! Are they abducting people now!?
Dialog_Action_990700183_4,Perhaps they know something that the Enclave want to know. We must go save them!
Dialog_Action_990700183_5,Let me talk to them.
Dialog_Action_990700183_6,After a while
Dialog_Action_990700183_7,Have you found out something?
Dialog_Action_990700183_8,"They said that Enclave people weren't interested in these artifacts, but they were interested in finding out a giant creature."
Dialog_Action_990700183_9,A giant creature? What did the Enclave find out here?
Dialog_Action_990700183_10,So they weren't interested in the artifacts... That means those soldiers must be sneaking out to steal stuff for themselves...
Dialog_Action_990700183_11,"Which means, there must be something more valuable to the Enclave."
Dialog_Action_990700183_12,"We should keep going... Oh right, I still need to trade something with these villagers."
Dialog_Action_990700184_1,There is an Enclave checkpoint ahead! Seems like we have ventured into the center of their camp!
Dialog_Action_990700184_2,They are aware of us now. This place is tightly defended!
Dialog_Action_990700184_3,But I found a small route. We can go inside their research tent and find out what they are working on.
Dialog_Action_990700184_4,It's not really important to our mission to find out what the Enclave people are up to. We just need to let our cat lady get to the pillar where they are standing on now.
Dialog_Action_990700184_5,But I am still curious... Have you forgotten about those scared Deathclaws? A group of ghouls cannot destroy Washington. They are probably investigating this matter.
Dialog_Action_990700184_6,"Very well, let's go check it out."
Dialog_Action_990700184_7,"Diary: [Apart from the tumulus, the mercenaries and I have come to the research center of the Enclave. ]"
Dialog_Action_990700184_8,Diary: [I am very confused by the Enclave's stuff. One thing that I cannot get out of my mind is a hologram of the Enclave. ]
Dialog_Action_990700184_9,"Diary: [The mercenaries don't know what these are, but I do. Such a huge shadow from the sky, it must be a dragon. It seems like this dragon is also teleported here. It was the one who slaughtered many lives on this land. ]"
Dialog_Action_990700184_10,"Diary: [In case the mercenaries refuse to travel with me, I haven't told them about this. I just hope that this dragon can stay as far as possible from this mountain. ]"
Dialog_Action_990700185_1,This is the Enclave temporary camp center! We must get rid of the Enclave to provide a stable environment for the lady.
Dialog_Action_990700185_2,All of the Enclave soldiers are here. This will be a hard battle.
Dialog_Action_990700185_3,"Therefore, my lady. Please don't be so stingy about spending your gold coins. We need more help from the Vault."
Dialog_Action_990700185_4,"As long as you can get rid of the Enclave people, that would be no problem."
Dialog_Action_990700185_5,You bastards! Do you have any idea what you are doing?!
Dialog_Action_990700185_6,Which is to get rid of you from this land!
Dialog_Action_990700185_7,You losers from Boston wouldn't understand what Capital Wasteland is facing! We are saving this land! And you ruined everything!
Dialog_Action_990700185_8,This is the first time that I've heard Enclave people would do good things.
Dialog_Action_990700185_9,Don't you have any ideas?! There is a flying beast coming with this mountain! It will destroy everything here! We are here to investigate it. But you have ruined all of our research!
Dialog_Action_990700185_10,I've never heard of that...
Dialog_Action_990700185_11,Shush... Did you forget? Didn't we find a great footprint while searching for the artifacts when those monsters from the forest were running for their lives?
Dialog_Action_990700185_12,You idiots! You must be fooled by that mutant behind you! She must be here along with this mountain! Now Capital Wasteland is going to hell because of you! This! This can't be the end!
Dialog_Action_990700185_13,".......Miss, I hope that you can give a good explanation when we get back."
Dialog_Action_990700186_1,"Vault, do you copy? How should I put it... I have arrived at the agreed location. But a group of Feral Ghouls were in our way, stalling some time. Now we only found a group of people melted with steel... And... a tape."
Dialog_Action_990700186_2,Aaah! Armor! The armor has melted! Ahhh! Oh god...
Dialog_Action_990700186_3,Our bullets can't hurt this monster! It is coming again! Ahhh!
Dialog_Action_990700186_4,Help... help... Burning! It's burning!
Dialog_Action_990700186_5,......
Dialog_Action_990700186_6,How about we pull everyone out
Dialog_Action_990700187_1,"Okay, cat lady. We have once again fulfilled our contract. But are you sure that the dragon will come back?"
Dialog_Action_990700187_2,"It definitely will. Because the dragon needs a moment to rest. Since it came with the mountain, it must be resting on the ruins on the top of the mountain."
Dialog_Action_990700187_3,"This place is filled with Gold, and there is an Nord ancient ruins. The dragon will return here. We must get ready for a powerful magic array until then so that we can imprison the dragon here."
Dialog_Action_990700187_4,"Okay. It sounds reasonable. So let's rest in this camp, then up the mountain!"
Dialog_Action_990700188_1,I feel so cold... and so tired. Why would a living being like this place?!
Dialog_Action_990700188_2,Stop complaining. You should thank the fact that it doesn't like our warm and comfortable Vault.
Dialog_Action_990700188_3,"Okay, let's check the map again."
Dialog_Action_990700188_4,"I will repeat the order from the Vault again. We are to enter the tumulus and place dynamites at these places. When the dragon flies back, we detonate them and bury it inside the tumulus. Then we let the cat lady activate the Teleportation Circle to bring it back!"
Dialog_Action_990700188_5,This is a good idea.
Dialog_Action_990700188_6,"Watch out. We must be close to the tumulus now. The dragon likes here, so would draugrs."
Dialog_Action_990700188_7,"Draugr? You mean, someone like Hancock?"
Dialog_Action_990700188_8,"No, I mean those crawling out of the front snow."
Dialog_Action_990700188_9,Ahh!
Dialog_Action_990700188_10,"Shut up! Are you trying to cause an avalanche and turn all of us into draugrs as well?! Look at the way they move, they can't be that hard to kill. Kill them!"
Dialog_Action_990700188_11,Is these draugrs? I think they should probably be like the Feral Ghouls to us. They looks not so tough.
Dialog_Action_990700188_12,"Look, a cavern near the mountain path. It must be some passage from the ancient tumulus. It probably leads to the interior of the mountain."
Dialog_Action_990700188_13,Then let's go inside and find out. And we can get warmed up by the way. I am frozen to death.
Dialog_Action_990700189_1,"Okay, the dynamite at this corner has been placed. Let's head to the next place."
Dialog_Action_990700189_2,We are getting closer to the mountain top now. I can feel the flowing of magic.
Dialog_Action_990700189_3,Oh! See what I have found? Is this some kind of fossil?
Dialog_Action_990700189_4,"Oh, that's dragon feces."
Dialog_Action_990700189_5,Ewww... I'm going to barf.
Dialog_Action_990700189_6,"Wait, why do I find Mirelurks' claws in the dragon feces? Does that mean..."
Dialog_Action_990700189_7,"It has just left, should be back soon. We must get rid of the draugrs around first."
Dialog_Action_990700190_1,"Okay, this place is cleared as well. Seems like we have taken out almost all of the draugrs. You should go to place the dynamite."
Dialog_Action_990700190_2,"Yeah, but there are quite a lot of them. Why do they all gather there. Were they mourning someone?"
Dialog_Action_990700190_3,Perhaps you will find out the answer when we go further. But let's get out of here first...
Dialog_Action_990700190_4,That's odd. Why suddenly it become dark?
Dialog_Action_990700190_5,Some water dripped on my head. Is it raining? Why does it smell so bad.
Dialog_Action_990700190_6,(Shivering) Don't... don't look up.
Dialog_Action_990700190_7,Growl!
Dialog_Action_990700190_8,Wahhhhh!! It is back. It is above our head!
Dialog_Action_990700190_9,Go back! Go back now!
Dialog_Action_990700191_1,"Oh no, we are trapped inside the tumulus! I can hear the dragon's wings on our heads! What should we do?!"
Dialog_Action_990700191_2,"What can we do?! We must find another way out! This is other people's tumulus, not mine!"
Dialog_Action_990700191_3,"Luckily, I have already set up the trap. We can detain this dragon as long as we get out. But how are we going out?"
Dialog_Action_990700191_4,It looks so dark... why isn't there even a torch...
Dialog_Action_990700191_5,Do you think the dead people still need light? Find a way yourself.
Dialog_Action_990700191_6,"If we choose to go along with the direction where the draugrs came from, perhaps we can find a new room."
Dialog_Action_990700191_7,I refuse! Now we must find a way to get out of here! Or we will all turn into draugrs!
Dialog_Action_990700191_8,Watch out! Draugrs' sounds.
Dialog_Action_990700191_9,"It must be the main chamber ahead! Get inside, we should be able to find many ways out once we get past the main chamber! At least we can tell the direction then!"
Dialog_Action_990700191_10,Finally... we are finally out. I don't know where the dragon goes...
Dialog_Action_990700191_11,
Dialog_Action_990700191_12,It is on top of us!
Dialog_Action_990700191_13,I hope that this tumulus is sturdy enough...
Dialog_Action_990700191_14,"Now that we have found a direction. Well, I want to look over to the place where the draugrs came from. Perhaps I can find something."
Dialog_Action_990700192_1,This must be the main chamber. We need to find another way out.
Dialog_Action_990700192_2,This place is so complicated. We must be very careful.
Dialog_Action_990700192_3,Let's go. I feel the chill on me already.
Dialog_Action_990700192_4,"Yeah, I am so tired."
Dialog_Action_990700192_5,You wouldn't be so tired if you take out the gold you stolen.
Dialog_Action_990700192_6,(Stares seriously)
Dialog_Action_990700192_7,"(Carefully takes out the gold) Okay, let's get going."
Dialog_Action_990700192_8,Growl!
Dialog_Action_990700192_9,Wahhhh! It looks so scary up close!
Dialog_Action_990700192_10,Don't... don't be afraid of... dragon... roar...
Dialog_Action_990700192_11,My bad! My bad! I shouldn't have hidden the gold coins!
Dialog_Action_990700192_12,"Stand up and get ready to fight, or you will really be burnt to death!"
Dialog_Action_990700192_13,We did it! It is wounded and lying on the ground now! Do it!
Dialog_Action_990700192_14,It is still struggling to fly! No way! We must hurt it more! If the lady's magic can deal some actual damage. Cover the lady.
Dialog_Action_990700192_15,Kill it!
Dialog_Action_990700193_1,Put on ear muffler. It should reduce the terrifying shock from the dragon roar!
Dialog_Action_990700193_2,It is wounded now and seems to be more annoyed! We must buy enough time for the lady to prepare for the magic!
Dialog_Action_990700193_3,I will use the most powerful magic to suppress it. Then you should detonate the dynamites. And I will send the whole mountain back by starting the Teleportation Circle!
Dialog_Action_990700193_4,Go!
Dialog_Action_990700193_5,We did it! God almighty! I have taken out a dragon!
Dialog_Action_990700193_6,It has fallen on the ground. Detonate the dynamites! Run now!
Dialog_Action_990700193_7,(The blasting sound from dynamites)
Dialog_Action_990700193_8,Excellent! I saw that we have collapsed the entire tumulus. The dragon and the rubbles are all buried in the main chamber! It can't stand up for a while!
Dialog_Action_990700193_9,Okay! Let's send this entire mountain back! Magic! Work!
Dialog_Action_990700193_10,"Finally, we have saved the Capital Wasteland!"
Dialog_Action_990700193_11,"Haha, I have also taken out many gold! This is a great haul!"
Dialog_Action_990700193_12,"Okay. The magic is working. The mountain has gradually turned opaque. Soon I can go back! Although you are all pretty greedy, you are still the finest mercenaries I have ever seen."
Dialog_Action_990700193_13,Phew... It's finally over. I can finally get out of this snow mountain. Let's get a cup of hot brew...
Dialog_Action_990700193_14,I always feel like... we have forgotten something...
Dialog_Action_990700193_15,What is it?
Dialog_Action_990700193_16,Oh right. Cat lady. Did you forget to send yourself home too?
Dialog_Action_990700193_17,!! I forgot!
Dialog_Action_990700194_1,"Help! Help! Please, you must help me. I am wounded. Could you please go back to my camp and bring me my stuff."
Dialog_Action_990700194_2,You will find a small empty lot if you go along this way. I have put all my stuff there.
Dialog_Action_990700194_3,"Okay. You can stay here, Dogmeat. I will bring the stuff of that lady here."
Dialog_Action_990700194_4,
Dialog_Action_990700195_1,"Okay, these are her stuff."
Dialog_Action_990700195_2,I have never seen these things before. I feel like they don't even belong to the Earth...
Dialog_Action_990700195_3,But a cat lady shouldn't be something from the Earth either.
Dialog_Action_990700195_4,Radiation has already changed the Wasteland.
Dialog_Action_990700196_1,The sun is setting. We must pick up the pace! I didn't expect that this guy just ran away like this!
Dialog_Action_990700196_2,It won't be good if it gets dark. We must save her before that!
Dialog_Action_990700197_1,Wowah! Thank god that you are here! Come save me!
Dialog_Action_990700197_2,Thank god that we followed you! Let's get her out!
Dialog_Action_990700198_1,We must retrieve the scattering books outside. They are just a group of mongrels. It should be easy. The outskirts are cleaned. Let's deal with the Deathclaws.
Dialog_Action_990700199_1,This is the second thing that I hate in my life - searching in the muddy water. What if I get attacked by a Mirelurk?
Dialog_Action_990700199_2,What about the thing that you hate the most?
Dialog_Action_990700199_3,I hate searching in the muddy water with you the most
Dialog_Action_990700200_1,Wow... Check out this thing. It looks pretty valuable...
Dialog_Action_990700200_2,Did you forget about what that cat told you?
Dialog_Action_990700200_3,It's just a tail!
Dialog_Action_990700200_4,Then you should cut a hole for every pants of yours.
Dialog_Action_990700201_1,"Alright. Lighten up. Even though we are surrounded by nothing but bad mud, there are still a lot of treasures beneath!"
Dialog_Action_990700201_2,They don't belong to us!
Dialog_Action_990700202_1,Have you noticed that the corpses of Mirelurks in the water were all shattered?
Dialog_Action_990700202_2,It must be the Enclave who did this.
Dialog_Action_990700202_3,Do you think that the Enclave people have the power to rip a Mirelurk in half? There are also some burnt Mirelurks.
Dialog_Action_990700202_4,Well... could it be the Deathclaws?
Dialog_Action_990700203_1,"Well, I don't think it is the Deathclaws. Look over here, such a huge footprint!"
Dialog_Action_990700203_2,"Yeah, I have never seen such a huge footprint before. Is this some new monster's?"
Dialog_Action_990700203_3,I agree... I have never seen such a huge monster... Let's get the job done and get out of here.
Dialog_Action_990700204_1,"This lab is so dark. It's worse than the Institute's lab... Oh, do you see what they hang on the wall?"
Dialog_Action_990700204_2,Animal hides from various animals.
Dialog_Action_990700204_3,What are they working on?
Dialog_Action_990700204_4,I don't think they are working on what these animals eat.
Dialog_Action_990700204_5,"Woah! Look at this, this is a video filmed by them."
Dialog_Action_990700204_6,What is that? Such a huge shadow cast from the sky. Then the camera was suddenly engulfed by fire. And I can hear sharp screeching and howling wind.
Dialog_Action_990700204_7,"I don't feel comfortable seeing that shadow. Perhaps, that is the monster who destroyed Capital Wasteland."
Dialog_Action_990700204_8,Look at the location of this video... Could it be that this monster has travelled to other places?! ?
Dialog_Action_990700204_9,We must report to the Vault immediately!
Dialog_Action_990700205_1,"Wow, there are more and more monsters here. But the decorations are so gorgeous around here."
Dialog_Action_990700205_2,That's right. I wonder why these people were gathering here.
Dialog_Action_990700205_3,I feel like... they didn't manage to flee in time. Do you see those dried-up corpses on the ground? They were all facing towards the entrance.
Dialog_Action_990700205_4,What actually have happened?!
Dialog_Action_990700206_1,"Okay, I knew I couldn't convince this cat."
Dialog_Action_990700206_2,Then let's pick up the pace! There is a monster on the top of our heads!
Dialog_Action_990700206_3,"Wow, there are more and more draugrs inside the further we go!"
Dialog_Action_990700206_4,And a lot more corpses. What actually happened here?
Dialog_Action_990700207_1,Look at this corpse. I feel like something... wrong.
Dialog_Action_990700207_2,"Miss, didn't you say that they were the loyal subjects of the buried lord? But it looks like they were running for their lives."
Dialog_Action_990700207_3,Actually they were all burnt to dried skull like this. It's obviously done by... that dragon on top of us.
Dialog_Action_990700207_4,Were... they attacked by the dragon?
Dialog_Action_990700207_5,Let's keep moving.
Dialog_Action_990700208_1,This is the... Wahh!
Dialog_Action_990700208_2,What is up with you... Wowah!
Dialog_Action_990700208_3,Wowah! So many gold!
Dialog_Action_990700208_4,Are all.. all... all of these gold? !
Dialog_Action_990700208_5,But I'd recommend that you stay away from it. Have you seen the twisted corpses on the ground? I think I have figured it out pretty much.
Dialog_Action_990700208_6,What do you know?
Dialog_Action_990700208_7,"Death is just like the snuffing of a lamp. Those histories on the artifacts are covered up. The remaining clothes indicate that they were the ancient Nord people. But they didn't stay loyal. They started to destroy the tumulus, trying to steal these gold."
Dialog_Action_990700208_8,"But to their surprise, these gold attracted this dragon. It has slain these gold thieves and captured this place."
Dialog_Action_990700208_9,The Nords are human. But they never saw that their peace would be kept by a dragon.
Dialog_Action_990700209_1,"Is this Earth? Barren, dilapidated, war-torn... but there are still signs of life."
Dialog_Action_990700209_2,I like this place. The life that can survive here must have tough and strong souls worth smelting into Argent Energy.
Dialog_Action_990700209_3,"Well, let's begin then! Let these insects here offer up their souls to become the eternal fuel of the great Maykr!"
Dialog_Action_990700209_4,"Oh? Look what we've found! An alien that lost their way. Good, then you'll be the first soul to fill this Argent Container!"
Dialog_Action_990700209_5,Very well! Let this great victory announce to the world that their queen has arrived!
Dialog_Action_990700209_6,"Go ahead, my loyal servants! Reap lives, smelt souls, and turn Earth into an eternal mine of the Maykr!"
Dialog_Action_990700209_7,Whoa! It sounds so beautiful when you put it that way. Sounds exactly like a super villain!
Dialog_Action_990700209_8,Shhh! Listen carefully to the queen!
Dialog_Action_990700210_1,"I'm disappointed by Tyrant! As a demon, how could he let himself be captured by demons."
Dialog_Action_990700210_2,"A loser has no right to appear in front of me again, but we cannot let mankind know too many secrets about us."
Dialog_Action_990700210_3,Let me deal with them in person. I'd like to see how far humans will go to ensure their survival!
Dialog_Action_990700210_4,How... How has this group of humans learned about the secret of our power?! They're even using our power to fight back against us!
Dialog_Action_990700210_5,Humans are really interesting. Such tough souls are the best fuel for the Maykr.
Dialog_Action_990700210_6,"Then, let me destroy your hope, devour your blood, and shatter your dreams!"
Dialog_Action_990700210_7,"Get up, Tyrant! I forgive your failure. Tell me who defeated you?"
Dialog_Action_990700210_8,A powerful human? How interesting. Take me there! We must get rid of this human promptly!
Dialog_Action_990700210_9,Oh! That is Doctor Hayden's invention!
Dialog_Action_990700210_10,"Doctor Hayden truly is smart. Even though both of us are robots, I have to admit that he's much better."
Dialog_Action_990700211_1,I can sense that there is powerful alien energy here.
Dialog_Action_990700211_2,I didn't expect that such energy could be contained in a human body. What a waste! I'll make the best use of them.
Dialog_Action_990700211_3,"No one can obstruct the Maykr's will to survive! The souls on Earth will turn into the fuel of the Maykr! I've taken control of this energy, and it will work for us from now on!"
Dialog_Action_990700211_4,Let me see how the humans on Earth resist!
Dialog_Action_990700211_5,Whoa! It looks terrifying. What if she wins?!
Dialog_Action_990700211_6,Would you still be sitting here if she won?
Dialog_Action_990700212_1,Look what we've found! It's a prison full of cute creatures captured by the humans!
Dialog_Action_990700212_2,"It seems that they are trying to strengthen these lizards with the energy of the blood nest, and then use these lizards to fight us."
Dialog_Action_990700212_3,How naive! Have they forgotten that the power of the blood nest comes from us?
Dialog_Action_990700212_4,I'll show them how terrifying the lizards can be after they are enhanced with energy from the blood nest.
Dialog_Action_990700212_5,Another group of faithful minions.
Dialog_Action_990700212_6,"Some creatures need to give souls to the Maykr, and some need to give their strength."
Dialog_Action_990700212_7,"Lizards, don't let the queen down."
Dialog_Action_990700212_8,The queen has found a comrade in arms! This is a devastating blow to humankind!
Dialog_Action_990700212_9,Which side are you on?
Dialog_Action_990700213_1,The humans are still struggling. Is this the limit of human power?
Dialog_Action_990700213_2,Look at this pile of scrap metal! Do you think you can stop the conquest of the Maykr with just this?
Dialog_Action_990700213_3,Then let me show you how insignificant you are!
Dialog_Action_990700213_4,What about later?!
Dialog_Action_990700213_5,Later...
Dialog_Action_990700213_6,?
Dialog_Action_990700213_7,"For now, you humans are the allies of the Maykr."
Dialog_Action_990700213_8,I'll help you take care of the enemies outside. You get the resources and I get the souls. I approve of this deal.
Dialog_Action_990700214_1,Warning! Warning! Invaders in Goodneighbor! Invaders in Goodneighbor!
Dialog_Action_990700214_2,What?! Goodneighbor has been seized by these gangsters?! What made them so powerful?
Dialog_Action_990700214_3,"Regardless, my money is still in Goodneighbor! The lives of other people have nothing to do with me, but I must get the money back! Wait... I hear someone calling for help ahead..."
Dialog_Action_990700214_4,"Hancock... No! Why are you here, Marowski? Which side are you on!"
Dialog_Action_990700214_5,"I am not interested in your lousy town. Tell me, what have they done since invading?!"
Dialog_Action_990700214_6,They took us by surprise! They seemed to be heading toward where you live. I don't know what they are trying to steal!
Dialog_Action_990700214_7,Damn it! Could those thieves be after my money?!
Dialog_Action_990700214_8,"Mayor Hancock is fighting against them, and I haven't heard from him for a while. You need to save him!"
Dialog_Action_990700214_9,"Forget Hancock, I only care about my money! My money!"
Dialog_Action_990700214_10,Mayor Hancock chased after them. He must know where your money was taken!
Dialog_Action_990700214_11,"Okay, okay! Damn it! Let me check my other things first!"
Dialog_Action_990700215_1,"Ouch! Bastards! I can forgive killing people, but you destroyed and burned down everything I have! I'll definitely get my money back!"
Dialog_Action_990700215_2,"Wait, I seem to hear a cry for help... Is it from downstairs?"
Dialog_Action_990700215_3,"I didn't expect you to save me, Marowski."
Dialog_Action_990700215_4,MacCready's upstairs. Go and save him too! There are still many thugs roaming around here. The two of us can't handle all of them.
Dialog_Action_990700215_5,Is that you Marowski? You're not here to rob us? Thank goodness! We would have become roasted Brahmins if you arrived even a minute later.
Dialog_Action_990700215_6,Bah! I don't care about you at all. Did you see a box?!
Dialog_Action_990700215_7,"Box? I might have seen one. When the bandits drove us in, they ransacked the place. I think they found a box full of caps."
Dialog_Action_990700215_8,That's it! That's my box! Where did they take it?!
Dialog_Action_990700215_9,I heard them say Dunwich Mine Pit.
Dialog_Action_990700215_10,Damn thieves! I'm asking you now to repay me. Take up your weapons and follow me to get back my money!
Dialog_Action_990700216_1,Do you want to go down the mine? Is it worth it for some caps?
Dialog_Action_990700216_2,"That's my money! I'm the king of the Wasteland, but they dared to steal my money! I will kill them all no matter where they go!"
Dialog_Action_990700216_3,"I have no more second chances in my life. For my future, nothing can stop me!"
Dialog_Action_990700216_4,Alright! I advise you to give yourself an injection first. I hear that most people down there... have gone mad.
Dialog_Action_990700216_5,This is a good thing. Let me see where my money is...
Dialog_Action_990700216_6,"Damn! I can't find my money. However, some Goodneighbor people are imprisoned here, they must know where my money is!"
Dialog_Action_990700216_7,"Oh, it's Marowski. It's great to have you here."
Dialog_Action_990700216_8,Have you seen a box full of caps?
Dialog_Action_990700216_9,"Oh my god! You just saved Goodneighbor's Magnolia. Why can't you be a little polite and add a ""dear""?"
Dialog_Action_990700216_10,"Okay, Magnolia. Have you seen my dear box that is full of caps?"
Dialog_Action_990700216_11,"I don't know, but if you can save more people trapped here, maybe they will know."
Dialog_Action_990700216_12,"Thanks a million, stranger!"
Dialog_Action_990700216_13,Did you see if they had a box of caps?
Dialog_Action_990700216_14,"I saw, but you need to do me a little favor first. Go kill the thug who ambused me!"
Dialog_Action_990700216_15,"...Okay! But you will tell me what I want to know after, right?"
Dialog_Action_990700217_1,"Ouch! I feel so bad! You haven't seen any illusions, yet?"
Dialog_Action_990700217_2,"Miss, once you get used to these illusions, you will realize they have no effect on you."
Dialog_Action_990700217_3,I only see my shiny caps in my head.
Dialog_Action_990700217_4,It seems that your desire for money is much stronger than these strange gods.
Dialog_Action_990700217_5,I can sense that there is a person both on the level above and below us.
Dialog_Action_990700217_6,Then go and find out where Hancock is. I need to hear who took my money directly from his mouth!
Dialog_Action_990700217_7,"I never thought that you would come to save me, Marowski."
Dialog_Action_990700217_8,Don't thank me. Where's my money?
Dialog_Action_990700217_9,"It was the lackeys of the Institute that attacked us. They had a powerful Synth, that's why they easily broke through our defense!"
Dialog_Action_990700217_10,"Even the Institute can't steal my money! I don't care how strong the Synth is. If he stole my money, I will kill him!"
Dialog_Action_990700217_11,Now they are on the way depeper into the mine with your money. It seems like there's an elevator that can reach the ground floor faster.
Dialog_Action_990700217_12,I must hurry!
Dialog_Action_990700217_13,"Haha! Marowski! You have been fooled! Now you are at the bottom of this mine pit, in the deepest part of the whispering hell! You'll die in the illusions!"
Dialog_Action_990700217_14,"I'm not afraid of the illusions! If there is a single cap missing, you'll be a dead man!"
Dialog_Action_990700217_15,Damn it! I'm too late! They have escaped!
Dialog_Action_990700217_16,"It doesn't matter, my friend. I can take you to the surface immediately, but it will be very uncomfortable."
Dialog_Action_990700217_17,I don't care! Do it!
Dialog_Action_990700218_1,(Panting) Let's... Let's see... where else... you can run... *heave*
Dialog_Action_990700218_2,"Take a deep breath, my friend. I know it doesn't feel good."
Dialog_Action_990700218_3,"Silver Shroud! Have you seen your Synth? He is only your shadow, but he can lead me to capture Goodneighbor! He also led you to this place where countless people have lost their lives!"
Dialog_Action_990700218_4,"However, you still survived! But so what? It seems that the underground illusions have severely tortured you. Then let me do it myself! Silver Shroud Synth, kill him!"
Dialog_Action_990700218_5,Go to hell with your Silver Shroud! Leave the money. I don't care what happens to you!
Dialog_Action_990700218_6,"Hah! I knew that there would be an elevator exit here! Damn it, you will pay for your attack on Goodneighbor!"
Dialog_Action_990700218_7,Money... My caps... I finally got them back...
Dialog_Action_990700218_8,Hmm... Is it a dream? Oh... It's a dream...
Dialog_Action_990700218_9,"I remember that I had lost my money, and then I took it back. It feels so good to get back my lost money..."
Dialog_Action_990700218_10,Wait... Why is this picture on my desk? What... Robbery?
Dialog_Action_990700218_11,My memory... My memory... Argh... Why...
Dialog_Action_990700218_12,Is it... Is it... My memory...
Dialog_Action_990700218_13,Is it artificial?!
Dialog_Action_990700219_1,"What?! What happened?! Everyone, please stop!"
Dialog_Action_990700219_2,It looks like a rebellion. I saw them opposing your father's policy of not allowing them to go out!
Dialog_Action_990700219_3,"Ah, what happened? They even kidnapped Dwellers from other Vaults! For the sake of the overall situation, I must rescue your friends first! Things will get worse if they get hurt!"
Dialog_Action_990700219_4,But they set fire in the corridor! I need a fire extinguisher to move forward.
Dialog_Action_990700219_5,"Piper, I'm sorry for what happened just now. It was an accident. Vault 101 definitely will not hurt you!"
Dialog_Action_990700219_6,I know. They didn't hurt us but wanted me to get them out of here.
Dialog_Action_990700219_7,Why do they want to leave? Isn't life in Vault 101 good?
Dialog_Action_990700219_8,"They yearn for freedom. Even if I tell them it's dangerous outside, they still want to go out."
Dialog_Action_990700219_9,"Regardless of what they want, they should not harm their compatriots! I'm the daughter of the Overseer, and I must stop them!"
Dialog_Action_990700219_10,"Amata, you are the daughter of the Overseer, but the target of this group of people is your father. They probably will unleash their anger on you!"
Dialog_Action_990700219_11,"I understand it's dangerous, but as the daughter of the Overseer, I have the responsibility to maintain the peace of the Vault. I must go."
Dialog_Action_990700220_1,"They even set fire to the Vault... This is our home, and we joined hands to build it together! Have they forgotten?"
Dialog_Action_990700220_2,Is the so-called freedom really more important than adequate food and clothing? Everyone has lived here for so long. How can they stand against the dangers outside...
Dialog_Action_990700220_3,"For their safety, I must get them back. The fire extinguisher is almost exhausted, I must use it carefully..."
Dialog_Action_990700220_4,Wait... Someone is calling for help?
Dialog_Action_990700220_5,"What the hell is going on? Why did you lock me up and open the door of the Vault?! It attracted mutated dogs here, and they almost killed me!"
Dialog_Action_990700220_6,"I'm really sorry about that. It's a rebellion, and it's definitely not the intention of Vault 101."
Dialog_Action_990700220_7,"Rebellion... Um, just as I guessed, but we must get this group of people back. They rushed out of the Vault without any preparation. They will be killed by the mutated creatures and Raiders!"
Dialog_Action_990700220_8,Thank you for your help. I will definitely bring them back!
Dialog_Action_990700220_9,"I can do it myself. Amata, you have never been to the Wasteland before. It's very dangerous there."
Dialog_Action_990700220_10,"(Holding the pistol tight) No, they are Dwellers of Vault 101. I have a responsibility to keep them safe. I must find them myself, but could you please help me?"
Dialog_Action_990700221_1,Is this the Wasteland? It's completely different from the Vault... Is this the smell of fresh air... There! What is that green-skinned man?!
Dialog_Action_990700221_2,Bring it on!!
Dialog_Action_990700221_3,"This is the real Wasteland, Amata! Fall back, let me handle these green-skinned monsters!"
Dialog_Action_990700221_4,Is this the Wasteland? Have you always been fighting with these monsters?
Dialog_Action_990700221_5,"In fact, this group of monsters are easy ones."
Dialog_Action_990700221_6,"Yes, there are many things in the Wasteland even more terrifying than them. The revels who rushed out don't know what danger awiats, and they will all die in the Wasteland."
Dialog_Action_990700221_7,"I see their footprints. By following their footprints, we can find them and get them back. Amata, can you still stand?"
Dialog_Action_990700221_8,I... I can! I can't let them die outside. I need to bring them back to safety!
Dialog_Action_990700222_1,"It looks like they were captured here. It's full of Raiders, and there are too many to handle on our own."
Dialog_Action_990700222_2,"Nick and Mother Isolde should be among them. They should be fine. We can look for them first, then go look for your compatriots."
Dialog_Action_990700222_3,"Don't be afraid, Amata! Since you are in the Wasteland now, you have to learn how to survive here. Watch how we fight with everything at our disposal!"
Dialog_Action_990700222_4,"Well, I'll use the items carefully."
Dialog_Action_990700222_5,My lady! I know where they are imprisoned. This gang of Raiders plans to sell them and haven't killed them yet.
Dialog_Action_990700222_6,Thank goodness! Mister... erm... Robot.
Dialog_Action_990700222_7,"No need to thank me. I'm a detective, and I'm just doing my job. Come with me."
Dialog_Action_990700222_8,Thanks a million for your help!
Dialog_Action_990700222_9,Maybe we should go a little slower and let them suffer a bit. They don't know the dangers of the Wasteland. I'm sure they have learned their lesson now.
Dialog_Action_990700222_10,Is this the freedom they seek?
Dialog_Action_990700222_11,"No, my lady. Freedom is not just doing what you want to do, but the right to do things that do not hinder the freedom of others. Unfortunately, they were out of their depth and did things that hurt others."
Dialog_Action_990700222_12,They should have stayed in the Vault...
Dialog_Action_990700222_13,"Once the door of the Vault is opened, it will be difficult to close it forever. Those who yearn for the world outside won't disappear but only increase. My lady, maybe you need to have an instructor in the Vault."
Dialog_Action_990700222_14,"Stop it! I'm the daughter of the Vault 101 Overseer! You kidnapped our Dwellers, now hand them over!"
Dialog_Action_990700222_15,"Hah, here comes another girl to court death. She looks pretty and can probably be sold at a good price!"
Dialog_Action_990700222_16,You won't even get within an inch of me!
Dialog_Action_990700222_17,"Ouch! Damn it! I surrender! I surrender! I'll free your people, and you let me go, okay?"
Dialog_Action_990700222_18,Free my people first.
Dialog_Action_990700222_19,"Amata, nothing good will come from negotiating with Raiders."
Dialog_Action_990700222_20,But... I don't want to kill someone who has surrendered.
Dialog_Action_990700222_21,"Well, I am touched to see kindness that has been long lost in the Wasteland. Since Amata said so, so be it."
Dialog_Action_990700223_1,"Look, Amata! This is the consequence of your kindness in the Wasteland. None of the Raiders have a conscience."
Dialog_Action_990700223_2,"In that case, we have no choice but to eliminate them."
Dialog_Action_990700223_3,That's right! It looks like you've learned how to be a person in power.
Dialog_Action_990700223_4,"Break it up! Let me handle this! Everyone, please help me solve these problems!"
Dialog_Action_990700223_5,"My pleasure, Miss Overseer."
Dialog_Action_990700223_6,Amata! You saved us!
Dialog_Action_990700223_7,"No, I just want you to survive."
Dialog_Action_990700223_8,It was our fault. Maybe if we had prepared better to leave the Vault things would be different. We will take any punishment to atone for our crime!
Dialog_Action_990700223_9,"No, I agree with you... Maybe my father's orders were too tough on you. The Wasteland is so big that we can't stay in the Vault forever... In fact, when I saw him leave the Vault, I also wanted to go with him. But, that's all a thing of the past."
Dialog_Action_990700223_10,"When we get back, Vault 101 needs to change. We'll need help from others, so that we can also enter the Wasteland."
Dialog_Action_990700224_1,"Cait, this is your first debut on the stage. Are you ready?"
Dialog_Action_990700224_2,Of course! This is not the first time I'm beating someone up. The last person fared poorly!
Dialog_Action_990700224_3,"Cait, they are not passing merchants, but evil Raiders. They're only here because they killed a lot of people!"
Dialog_Action_990700224_4,Do I look like a weak person?
Dialog_Action_990700224_5,"I just hope you will be careful. If you die, my money spent buying you will be wasted."
Dialog_Action_990700224_6,Just leave me two injections.
Dialog_Action_990700224_7,"Okay, now let me get ready to kick that guy's butt. But before that, find some meds for me."
Dialog_Action_990700224_8,"Oh, here comes a weak lass! How do you want to be killed by me?"
Dialog_Action_990700224_9,I have only one request.
Dialog_Action_990700224_10,What?!
Dialog_Action_990700224_11,We fight to the death. Only one survives.
Dialog_Action_990700224_12,Let's congratulate our champion! Cait was the last one left standing! All hail the champion!
Dialog_Action_990700225_1,"Oh my god, Cait! I can even feel the heat waves standing here. Be careful!"
Dialog_Action_990700225_2,I have seen more dangerous places. This won't be the first time I'm burned either.
Dialog_Action_990700225_3,"Ladies and gentlemen, I declare the battle royale started! Both sides must enter the sea of fire and try to kill the rival by all means to survive! Go forth and defeat the flames and the enemy. Remember, only one person can survive!"
Dialog_Action_990700225_4,"Very well, this heat wave is nothing serious. Let me give myself an injection first."
Dialog_Action_990700225_5,Hah! Look what I've found! A trembling rat!
Dialog_Action_990700225_6,"Oh god, what kind of monster are you!?"
Dialog_Action_990700225_7,"In this distorted Wasteland, only monsters can survive! Die!!"
Dialog_Action_990700225_8,Let us see who's walking out! It is our new champion Cait! She defeated the fire and the enemy and is the well-deserved champion!
Dialog_Action_990700226_1,Oh no... I can't...
Dialog_Action_990700226_2,"Look at the pistol in my hand, and say it again! Let's settle it like this. Get your girl here, and then the matter has nothing else to do with you. You'll just have to collect the body later!"
Dialog_Action_990700226_3,But... but...
Dialog_Action_990700226_4,"No buts! This is your money, take it!"
Dialog_Action_990700226_5,Damn Tommy for calling me here! It's obviously a trap! I'm outnumbered and they are carrying weapons!
Dialog_Action_990700226_6,"The door is probably locked now. Now I can only move forward, but it's okay, I'm going to punch that cheating bastard hard!"
Dialog_Action_990700226_7,"Hah! Useless things! Even if you greatly outnumber me and carry weapons, you're still just a useless thing that can't kill me!"
Dialog_Action_990700226_8,Don't let it go to your head! You still have to deal with me!
Dialog_Action_990700226_9,"I'll knock you out, and then wake you up, so I can beat you up again!"
Dialog_Action_990700226_10,"Stop fighting! I didn't mean to do it. Tommy and I were both forced to do so! If you get out alive, both of us will be killed!"
Dialog_Action_990700226_11,Then tell me who is behind this?!
Dialog_Action_990700226_12,"He is in this apartment! He must be there! But he is well protected! He is also very strong, and he has a Power Suit... You're not his match!"
Dialog_Action_990700226_13,"Hah! I'm good at opening tin cans! Just wait, I'll tear him and his Power Suit apart!"
Dialog_Action_990700227_1,"Well, this apartment is really heavily guarded. It'll be difficult to take care of them with my bare hands."
Dialog_Action_990700227_2,"However, I found some lucky bullets. With them, I can end this!"
Dialog_Action_990700227_3,"I need to look around for bullets... Argh, the effect of the meds is beginning to wear off... My whole body hurts... My medicine... I need an injection."
Dialog_Action_990700227_4,Damn! You shot me! Cheating scum!
Dialog_Action_990700227_5,"You cheated and sneaked an attack in first! But now you walk to talk about fairness?! Go to hell, tin can!"
Dialog_Action_990700227_6,Show me what you can do then!!
Dialog_Action_990700227_7,Damn it... My men... won't... let you off... They will... burn your arena down!
Dialog_Action_990700227_8,"Humph! If that's the case, then let me kill all your men!"
Dialog_Action_990700228_1,This gang of Raiders probably never thought that someone would attack them. They're as defenseless as a baby.
Dialog_Action_990700228_2,Then let me teach them how terrible the Wasteland is! I'll use an injection first!
Dialog_Action_990700228_3,"Phew... Killing so many Raiders all in one go took quite a bit of effort. However, it seems like we got them all."
Dialog_Action_990700228_4,I eliminated an entire Raider gang tonight. It probably will make other cheating scums thinking twice about attacking me in the future.
Dialog_Action_990700228_5,Oh... Sunshine... It feels so warm upon the Wasteland.
Dialog_Action_990700228_6,But when will I be able to enjoy the warm sunshine freely?
Dialog_Action_990700229_1,"(Flipping a book) According to what I have heard from travelers, when we arrive at an unfamiliar place, we should choose a leeward location and set camp there, so that we won't be discovered."
Dialog_Action_990700229_2,"(Flipping a book) Fortunately, I've also followed the instructions in the book to leave markers all the way here, so we won't get lose. I'm probably the first person to come to this building. It seems that there is no one around..."
Dialog_Action_990700229_3,(Alert) Umm! Someone triggered my trap?!
Dialog_Action_990700229_4,Damn! Someone else is already here?! What did I step on?!
Dialog_Action_990700229_5,"Don't make a fuss! Isn't it nice to have people here? Our goal is to lure that group of people out of the town, and then tie them up here so that we can take everything without hurting anyone."
Dialog_Action_990700229_6,"Haha, that's a good idea! Let's catch this guy then!"
Dialog_Action_990700229_7,Oh no! Damn it! This is a trap! They wanted us all here!
Dialog_Action_990700229_8,"Calm down! Let me read what the book says... Oh yes, use all the items around you to improve your fighting abilities and seize the opportunity to defeat them!"
Dialog_Action_990700230_1,Damn! How could I forget the most important point for adventurers— to keep calm in the face of danger and find an escape route before engaging in battle. Where am I now... This must be their meeting place...
Dialog_Action_990700230_2,Calm down! Let me see... Did I ever write down what I should do in such a situation?
Dialog_Action_990700230_3,"Yes! When there is a crowd of enemies, skillfully use movable items to avoid them, and look for a weapon to eliminate them!"
Dialog_Action_990700230_4,Well... Let me see what items I can find with the rope to help me escape.
Dialog_Action_990700231_1,"Anyway, there is some good news too. I can't go back, but I found another exit ahead..."
Dialog_Action_990700231_2,It's just that I need to get the key from the Raider boss. I guess... I have to defeat him first.
Dialog_Action_990700231_3,But... how should I do it? I'm not good at using guns... Let me take a look at the map I stole from the Raiders.
Dialog_Action_990700231_4,"Wait, it shows that there is a ""secret weapon"" of the Raiders nearby! Let me check it out. As long as I get this ""secret weapon"", I'll definitely be able to defeat the Raider boss!"
Dialog_Action_990700231_5,"Give up! I've uncovered your conspiracy, and I'm carrying your secret weapon! Surrender and leave Megaton now, and I promise not to hurt you!"
Dialog_Action_990700231_6,"Haha! You are too late, rat! Our men have captured those greedy bastards, and our main force has arrived at Megaton! What can you do even if you kill me? Do you think you can leave this place alive?!"
Dialog_Action_990700231_7,"Let me kill you first, before I take care of the enemies in Megaton!"
Dialog_Action_990700231_8,Shit! Their secret weapon is one-off...
Dialog_Action_990700231_9,But I can't run away... They've captured everyone in Megaton and I must rescue them!
Dialog_Action_990700232_1,"Oh my god! They've imprisoned everyone here... The radiation level here is dangerous, my Geiger Counter is ringing nonstop..."
Dialog_Action_990700232_2,"Let me see what the book says. Um... The environment of some areas may be harsh, but if there are people still living there, it means they have machines to purify the environment."
Dialog_Action_990700232_3,Hmm... Then let me find the purification machine first... I should collect useful items and take the advantage before fighting!
Dialog_Action_990700232_4,Stop it! Release Megaton's Dwellers! You are alone now!
Dialog_Action_990700232_5,"Hahaha, you are too late! We've taken away the thing we want from Megaton! I can release the Dwellers, but only because you're going to be killed by your own bomb!"
Dialog_Action_990700232_6,What are you talking about? Are you going to detonate the nuclear bomb?!
Dialog_Action_990700232_7,Bingo! You guessed it right! Would you like me to award you with a RAD-X?
Dialog_Action_990700232_8,You bastards! I'll make you pay!
Dialog_Action_990700232_9,Damn! There's no time to waste! Should I run away? I should be able to get out of the blast radius in time...
Dialog_Action_990700232_10,"No, I can't do that! Megaton is a good place, everyone here is kind and nice... Even in the Wasteland, I have to have kind thought. This is one of the few good places left!"
Dialog_Action_990700232_11,There must be time to stop the explosion!
Dialog_Action_990700233_1,"Fortunately, the bomb has not yet detonated."
Dialog_Action_990700233_2,"There are many enemies here, but I don't have time to take care of them one by one. I need to avoid fighting and also prepare a variety of enhancement potions to deal with the last enemy."
Dialog_Action_990700233_3,"They won't let me stop the detonation easily, and it will be a fierce battle in the end. But as long as I'm 100% prepared, there will be no enemy that I can't defeat!"
Dialog_Action_990700233_4,"Plan the route, avoid battles, accumulate advantages, and prepare for the decisive battle!"
Dialog_Action_990700233_5,Stop it! I'll never allow you to destroy this town!
Dialog_Action_990700233_6,"Haha, is a dead person talking? Do you think a little lady like you can stop us by yourself?!!"
Dialog_Action_990700233_7,"There is still time! Oh, thank goodness. The countdown stopped! Megaton is saved."
Dialog_Action_990700233_8,Are adventures always this exciting? Oh no! My heart can't take it anymore...
Dialog_Action_990700233_9,Well... I think I'd rather take care of my store in the future. Maybe there will be some kind person that can help me finish this book...
Dialog_Action_990700234_1,Reporting back to Vault. I've reached the door of Vault 996.
Dialog_Action_990700234_2,The situation is not looking good. The gate of Vault 996 was broken and cannot be closed. Many beasts have entered it.
Dialog_Action_990700234_3,"It looks like Vault 996 was raided, so the Dwellers there fled to our Vault."
Dialog_Action_990700234_4,We will clear out the invading beasts and help the Dwellers of Vault 996 reclaim their home.
Dialog_Action_990700235_1,"Work... Work... The Vault gave me a job, so I have to work..."
Dialog_Action_990700235_2,Whoa! What's going on?! The Dwellers working here have mutated!
Dialog_Action_990700235_3,"It's normal. Both the water purification plant and the power plant have high radiation, but these Dwellers don't even have a RAD-X."
Dialog_Action_990700235_4,Wouldn't they have tried to leave?
Dialog_Action_990700235_5,"According to the computer, the last time the gate was opened was three months ago. Perhaps the gate was damaged, or Vault 996 had no time to fix it after being attacked."
Dialog_Action_990700235_6,But what these people said...
Dialog_Action_990700235_7,They are still working on the brink of death? It seems that they love this Vault very much. Let's get rid of the beasts in the Vault first.
Dialog_Action_990700235_8,You are right.
Dialog_Action_990700236_1,Work... Get to work...
Dialog_Action_990700236_2,You are lucky to be able to work in this Vault! You want to leave after working for only one month...
Dialog_Action_990700236_3,"I didn't expect that the foreman and the Overseer had mutated. Their minds must have been affected too. Listen to what they said just now, are they still human?"
Dialog_Action_990700236_4,No... Mutation shouldn't affect the mind. They would have been like this when they were alive...
Dialog_Action_990700236_5,"In this case, they deserve it! Let's continue exploring the lower level."
Dialog_Action_990700236_6,"Now the question is... Did that group of people love their work, or they were forced to do so?"
Dialog_Action_990700237_1,Warning! Someone is slacking off... Warning! Someone is slacking off...
Dialog_Action_990700237_2,It has nothing to do with me. I'm not even your Dweller!
Dialog_Action_990700237_3,All the guards are here. They look like robots.
Dialog_Action_990700237_4,Amazing! Our Vault doesn't have robots that can patrol. We only use them to deliver things.
Dialog_Action_990700237_5,But their robots are used not to protect the Vault but to prevent Dwellers from coming here!
Dialog_Action_990700237_6,They have such smart robots. Why didn't they use them to produce supplies and instead had the Dwellers do the dangerous job?!
Dialog_Action_990700237_7,I think this may not be just a beast invasion! Maybe someone deliberately destroyed Vault 996. Let's go investigate.
Dialog_Action_990700238_1,"Investigations are completed. No invaders were found, but this group of robots seem to have killed a lot of Dwellers who sneaked here."
Dialog_Action_990700238_2,"They have gone too far! Robots should serve their Dwellers, not rule over them."
Dialog_Action_990700238_3,That's not the truth. There must be someone using the robots to overpower the Dwellers.
Dialog_Action_990700238_4,You mean...
Dialog_Action_990700238_5,The culprit may not be from outside.
Dialog_Action_990700239_1,Report... Someone has escaped... and returned...
Dialog_Action_990700239_2,"Pooh! I thought that I could communicate with him, but it turns to he's a jerk!"
Dialog_Action_990700239_3,I found a lot of caps on him. It seems like he reported many people!
Dialog_Action_990700239_4,"If everyone acts like this, then the Dwellers of Vault 996 might... have been forced to work so hard!"
Dialog_Action_990700239_5,"That's right! If not, who is this man reporting to? It's obvious someone in Vault 996 forced the poor Dwellers to work!"
Dialog_Action_990700239_6,"He has so many caps, then the person behind him must have more caps! There's definitely something fishy about Vault 996's Overseer!"
Dialog_Action_990700239_7,Maybe there were no thieves at all. The wealth that originally belonged to the Dwellers were taken away by these villains!
Dialog_Action_990700240_1,"Look, how many caps the people next to Overseer are holding!"
Dialog_Action_990700240_2,Those poor Dwellers are going to starve to death. It turns out that it was the Overseer that took away the fruits of their labor!
Dialog_Action_990700240_3,"We must eliminate this Vault, or the Overseers of other Vaults will follow the example of the Overseer in Vault 996 when they see how rich they can become!"
Dialog_Action_990700240_4,Go and kill this bloodsucker!
Dialog_Action_990700241_1,Hah! It turns out that the culprit was Dr. Brainwash! He brainwashed everyone.
Dialog_Action_990700241_2,"The terrifying thing is that clones of Dr. Brainwash are now dispersed throughout the Wasteland, and we don't know which Vaults they are lurking in!"
Dialog_Action_990700241_3,We have no way to get to all the Vaults and help the Dwellers there stop Dr. Brainwash...
Dialog_Action_990700241_4,"But I believe that other people will see through the conspiracy of Dr. Brainwash too. As long as a Dweller stands up against him, he will not win!"
Dialog_Action_990700241_5,"Yes, the Dwellers will have to save themselves. As long as they are not brainwashed, they won't be exploited by Dr. Brainwash!"

Dialog_Action_990700247_2,"If I can get this batch of goods, not only would the Minutemen be willing to pay a high price, but I will also get enough Power Suits to modify."
Dialog_Action_990700247_3,Opening a Power Suit modification factory will make me feel like a superhero! I have already designed its logo. It will be called Atom Cat!
Dialog_Action_990700247_4,But let me check it out first to see if they really are here.
Dialog_Action_990700247_5,"Another fool has come to court death! Bros, kill him and grab his Power Suit!"
Dialog_Action_990700247_6,Hah! Do you think I'm a fool?! I won't even have a chance of survival if I give you my Power Suit.
Dialog_Action_990700247_7,So you want to do this the hard way? Beat him up!
Dialog_Action_990700247_8,It seems like you don't know how many AP syringes are in this Power Suit! These are high-end ones that take effect immediately after injection! I'll let you taste the power of justice!
Dialog_Action_990700247_9,I didn't expect this so-called treasure legend to be a trap.
Dialog_Action_990700247_10,Sigh. What a futile trip! Wait. Is that a cry for help?
Dialog_Action_990700248_1,Hah! It's really dangerous in the Wasteland. I've just been here a little while but I already hear someone calling for help!
Dialog_Action_990700248_2,How can a superhero like me ignore people in danger? Let me see who has been captured...
Dialog_Action_990700248_3,"You really are a true brother! From now on, you are considered a good friend of the Republic of Dave!"
Dialog_Action_990700248_4,"Oh, my dear brother, are you also here for the supposed Power Suits?"
Dialog_Action_990700248_5,"Of course, but it seems that Dave has missed this opportunity. The Power Suits must have been salvaged by this group of Raiders, otherwise, they would not have been able to capture Dave."
Dialog_Action_990700248_6,What?! Is all you said true?
Dialog_Action_990700248_7,Of course! I saw it with my own eyes!
Dialog_Action_990700248_8,"Alright! In that case, I need you to give me a hand. Help me get the Power Suits!"
Dialog_Action_990700248_9,No problem. Dave coincidentally knows where the antidote to the poisonous insects is. We will definitely need it.
Dialog_Action_990700248_10,Whoa! Who are you?!
Dialog_Action_990700248_11,Stop yapping! Hand over the Power Suits to me!
Dialog_Action_990700248_12,"Did you think we would leave them here? You stupid thieves. Guards, kill them!"
Dialog_Action_990700248_13,Do you even have the right to call us thieves?
Dialog_Action_990700248_14,"They took the Power Suits away, but he carried a map, and it marks the location of a gunmen camp. Did they sell the goods to the gunmen?"
Dialog_Action_990700248_15,It seems that I need help from someone familiar with the gunmen...
Dialog_Action_990700249_1,Wow! It looks like the camp up ahead has been destroyed by mutants. Are you sure you want to go in?
Dialog_Action_990700249_2,Of course! I cannot be sure that this batch of goods isn't inside.
Dialog_Action_990700249_3,"Then you'll have to pay me more. We previously agreed that we were going to deal with gunmen, but now it turns out to be mutants."
Dialog_Action_990700249_4,Rest assured! The Minutemen will pay good money for them. You will be rich after we finish this.
Dialog_Action_990700249_5,That's good to know.
Dialog_Action_990700249_6,"Hey, big man! Have you seen lots of shiny metal suits?"
Dialog_Action_990700249_7,"There is nothing in this camp, tiny human! Only powerful mutants and pots here!"
Dialog_Action_990700249_8,Yoho! It seems like this mutant has retained its intelligence. It completed a whole sentence!
Dialog_Action_990700249_9,"But you probably won't be able to break my armor, green men!"
Dialog_Action_990700249_10,"It looks the goods aren't here, and you're going to search at another camp. By the way, according to the agreement, it will cost you extra."
Dialog_Action_990700249_11,No problem! Let me see where the next place is... Umm? Something mine pit?
Dialog_Action_990700249_12,Then I think you'll need another person's help...
Dialog_Action_990700250_1,"Oh, this place... seems to be detrimental to our health... MacCready? MacCready?!"
Dialog_Action_990700250_2,Ah! Argh! Stay away! Ah! Leave me alone! Argh!!
Dialog_Action_990700250_3,"MacCready! He ran away... Argh... No, I must find the archaeologist as soon as possible. And then I need to get MacCready back..."
Dialog_Action_990700250_4,"I must warn you, you shouldn't stay in this place too long, or your spirit will be destroyed."
Dialog_Action_990700250_5,"Okay, let's make it quick."
Dialog_Action_990700250_6,Gosh! It's horrible here. No human could live in this place.
Dialog_Action_990700250_7,Maybe it was safer to hand over the goods to mad people.
Dialog_Action_990700250_8,This group of gunmen have been living here for so long. They must have spirit boosting Chems and powerful weapons. Let's get these first and then eliminate them.
Dialog_Action_990700250_9,The goods don't seem to be here either.
Dialog_Action_990700250_10,"It also means that we are getting closer and closer to this batch of goods, right?"
Dialog_Action_990700250_11,The sound in my head is going to drive me crazy! This is a work injury! I need to go back to Goodneighbor and take a good rest. Remember to pay us on time.
Dialog_Action_990700251_1,It turns out that this batch of goods has been sold to the Enclave by the gunman!
Dialog_Action_990700251_2,They are too many to fight. We can't break through head-on...
Dialog_Action_990700251_3,"Maybe we can use the Stealth Boy to avoid those blind Enclaves... After all, my purpose is to get the goods."
Dialog_Action_990700251_4,Wait! I saw them guarding some iron cages. Did they capture some people as well?
Dialog_Action_990700251_5,Maybe those people can help me.
Dialog_Action_990700251_6,I didn't expect to save you a second time!
Dialog_Action_990700251_7,"We must really be of the same blood! I tracked the goods down to this place, but I didn't expect that the Enclaves were waiting here!"
Dialog_Action_990700251_8,"Alright! Now tell me, where are the goods?"
Dialog_Action_990700251_9,Be careful! The Enclaves is a hard group to fight. Let's collect more useful items!
Dialog_Action_990700251_10,What are you trying to steal?!
Dialog_Action_990700251_11,These things are not yours!
Dialog_Action_990700251_12,Whoa! That's a lot of Power Suits!
Dialog_Action_990700251_13,You'll make a fortune this time. Where are you going to sell them?
Dialog_Action_990700251_14,"I won't sell them to anyone—maybe some to the Minutemen, then I'll use the rest to open a Power Suit modification club!"
Dialog_Action_990700251_15,Sounds cool! Have you thought of a name?
Dialog_Action_990700251_16,It'll be called the Atom Cats Repair Shop!
Dialog_Action_990700252_1,"Strong, I hope you could help me with this. I'm very interested in mutants like yourself, so I need you to protect me as I explore your home."
Dialog_Action_990700252_2,Strong hate it back there. Mutants there are dangerous!
Dialog_Action_990700252_3,"Don't be afraid, Strong. Look, I've prepared a potion for you. It can make you stronger. It's called [Essence of Humanity V0.1 Beta]. If you can help me get more experimental data, I believe that I will be able to develop the milk of humanity you want."
Dialog_Action_990700252_4,Really? Strong want this! Strong wants to be stronger!
Dialog_Action_990700252_5,"That's great! Come on, here is the potion. Let me record your subsequent reactions, see if it can enhance your physique... and also, if it will causes any serious side effects."
Dialog_Action_990700252_6,Urgh!!! Strong feel sick...
Dialog_Action_990700252_7,"Hmm... It seems that the beta version can indeed enhance the user's physique, but the side effects are also... unfortunate... It can't be used right now... Sigh! When will I draw upon the inspiration of the great scientists?"
Dialog_Action_990700252_8,This no milk of humanity! Not make Strong stronger!
Dialog_Action_990700252_9,"Easy, Strong! It takes time to create the milk of humanity. We need more data to get it done... Hmm... Wait a minute, this is a message from the Vault..."
Dialog_Action_990700252_10,Curie! Strong! Nick is in trouble. He went to track down a few missing Dwellers but hasn't come back. He's probably has been caught by Raiders... If possible...
Dialog_Action_990700252_11,"Roger that! This is the first time I'm executing a Vault mission! I'll go save Nick, and Strong will come with me!"
Dialog_Action_990700252_12,Uhh... I only wanted Strong to go... But it's okay if you two go together.
Dialog_Action_990700253_1,"Strong, we have arrived at the place where Nick disappeared. Can you sense where Nick is?"
Dialog_Action_990700253_2,Strong just feels that there are a lot of tiny humans here!
Dialog_Action_990700253_3,"Okay, then let's be more careful and try not to cause..."
Dialog_Action_990700253_4,Grrrrrr! You tiny humans! Come fight Strong!
Dialog_Action_990700253_5,"...Forget it, Strong! Take this. It can be considered [Essence of Humanity V0.2 Beta], but it probably has some... residual radiation."
Dialog_Action_990700253_6,Strong don't want this!
Dialog_Action_990700253_7,"Did I hear wrong? My auditory processor must be broken. You just said yes, right?"
Dialog_Action_990700253_8,Strong feel... sick again... Urgh!!!
Dialog_Action_990700253_9,"Oh-ho, little miss! Your potion has made Strong so weak. That's quite a feat."
Dialog_Action_990700253_10,Looks like the radiation from the potion was a little bit too strong...
Dialog_Action_990700253_11,"Miss, next time please ensure that the Chem won't cause severe side effects before trying it out on someone."
Dialog_Action_990700253_12,Sigh! It seems that this potion has failed again. When will I be able to make an invincible potion so that I can travel freely in the Wasteland?
Dialog_Action_990700253_13,"Miss, there are many dangers out in the Wasteland, but you can overcome them if you have a trusted companion... Please excuse my departure. I found the kidnapped Dwellers but was ambushed. Now I have to..."
Dialog_Action_990700253_14,I can help you! Tell me where there are!
Dialog_Action_990700253_15,"Okay... I've slightly... destroyed the place, so be careful."
Dialog_Action_990700254_1,"Okay, take a deep breath. There's no need to be nervous..."
Dialog_Action_990700254_2,I used to be a Miss Handy and could not die... but now I can die... so I must be careful. Avoid traps and be on the look out for enemies.
Dialog_Action_990700254_3,"Although all the previous potions have side effects, I can weaken the side effects by removing the radiation. I hope that the radiation won't make me a ghoul... Oh I forgot, I'm a Synth and I won't mutate."
Dialog_Action_990700254_4,Oh! I didn't expect that it'll be you to save me!
Dialog_Action_990700254_5,"Miss, you are injured. I suggest you go back to the Vault for a full check-up."
Dialog_Action_990700254_6,"I do need to go back for treatment, but Curie, you need to send these Chems to Nate quickly! They were originally escorting the Synth away, but now they are surrounded by a group of Synths. I was captured here by Raiders on my way to help them!"
Dialog_Action_990700254_7,Oh! Protect the Synth! Nate is a good man. I'll go help him!
Dialog_Action_990700254_8,"Thank you again, Curie! I have marked the location of Nate for you. Please rescue him as soon as possible!"
Dialog_Action_990700255_1,Oh! It looks like this is the destination. I've heard of houses like this before. It's a Railroad safe house.
Dialog_Action_990700255_2,"Even if this house is occupied, the people hiding inside the safe house will be safe, and they will be able to leave safely after the pursuers from the Institute leave."
Dialog_Action_990700255_3,"But I need to be careful. I'm currently also a Synth, and the Synths of the Institute will not let me off."
Dialog_Action_990700255_4,"Fortunately, the potion in my hand has proven to be usable, as long as I can remove the radiation in time. I believe that Nate and others will need them too."
Dialog_Action_990700255_5,"Thank goodness! Although, I didn't expect you to be the one to come help me."
Dialog_Action_990700255_6,"Mr. Nate, please let me do a medical scan for you... Oh, I forgot that I don't have a scanner anymore."
Dialog_Action_990700255_7,You don't seem to be very familiar with this body yet?
Dialog_Action_990700255_8,"I'm just not familiar with it yet... I have started developing potions, but... they have some side effects."
Dialog_Action_990700255_9,"It doesn't matter, Curie. You just need something to stimulate your inspiration."
Dialog_Action_990700255_10,So where can I find this stimulation?
Dialog_Action_990700255_11,"As long as you are living, you'll find inspiration."
Dialog_Action_990700255_12,"Alright, Curie. Now the Synths are safe too."
Dialog_Action_990700255_13,That's great! All the Synths will be able to enjoy a free life.
Dialog_Action_990700255_14,"Of course, everyone has the right to that! Curie, now you can go find your inspiration."
Dialog_Action_990700256_1,"Okay, miss! Next, we need to rescue that detective of yours, but why did you ask me to come along with you?"
Dialog_Action_990700256_2,That's because I'm very interested in your radroaches. I hear the call of inspiration! Radroaches have such a strong survivability. Can we use radroaches to develop enhancement potions?
Dialog_Action_990700256_3,You're actually interested in this group of radroaches... Are you going to collect their bodies?
Dialog_Action_990700256_4,"That's right! Most of the wild radroaches have been eliminated by us, so I hope you could give me the bodies of the radroaches after the battle."
Dialog_Action_990700256_5,"Oh, what a strange combination! Curie, have you thought of something again?"
Dialog_Action_990700256_6,"Nick, I have drawn inspiration from radroaches. I hope that the potion I make this time will be effective. Do you want an injection?"
Dialog_Action_990700256_7,"As an old robot, I don't need injections. Try it out on our friend."
Dialog_Action_990700256_8,...Alright. I believe that something made from radroaches won't be that harmful! Aaaaargh! I feel power!
Dialog_Action_990700256_9,"Curie, have you succeeded?"
Dialog_Action_990700256_10,I feel... argh... so uncomfortable...
Dialog_Action_990700256_11,Well... It seems to have failed again... Is inspiration alone not enough?
Dialog_Action_990700256_12,"That's true, Curie. Human inspiration is an unreliable thing."
Dialog_Action_990700257_1,Ad victoriam! Proctor Ingram! You came just in time! We are badly battered due to lack of manpower!
Dialog_Action_990700257_2,Ad victoriam! Knight of Lyons! I came as fast as I received the order. What orders do you have?
Dialog_Action_990700257_3,"Proctor Ingram, our main force is currently in a decisive battle with the Enclave, but Brandys, our scouting party, has been surrounded by the Enclave in another area. I need you to rescue our brothers!"
Dialog_Action_990700257_4,At your command!
Dialog_Action_990700257_5,"Very good, Proctor Ingram! I'm going to battle the Enclave now. I look forward to your good news. Ad victoriam!"
Dialog_Action_990700257_6,Ad victoriam!
Dialog_Action_990700257_7,"Everything is ready to carry out the mission! Look at my nuclear bomb, it can blow up all enemies in our way! Let's go rescue my comrades!"
Dialog_Action_990700257_8,"Thanks for your help, sister."
Dialog_Action_990700257_9,You are too kind. Let's go to the evacuation point and leave!
Dialog_Action_990700257_10,"Here, we are safe now. Let's get out of this place and go to assist the Brotherhood after replenishing out supplies!"
Dialog_Action_990700258_1,Mayday! Mayday! I'm Proctor Ingram! Our Vertibird was shot down! We're now surrounded by enemies! We need help!
Dialog_Action_990700258_2,"Proctor, if we can't stand up, we will be skinned before the reinforcements arrive!"
Dialog_Action_990700258_3,Help me! Remove the debris on my legs!!
Dialog_Action_990700258_4,"Are you okay, Proctor?"
Dialog_Action_990700258_5,"The Power Suit is damaged, but I'm fine! The Raiders are here! Get ready to fight!"
Dialog_Action_990700258_6,"We are safe now. Proctor, could you get in touch with headquarters?"
Dialog_Action_990700258_7,"The signal isn't good, and the communication is intermittent, but I don't think we can get reinforcements. The Brotherhood can't spare anymore manpower."
Dialog_Action_990700258_8,Let's go back to headquarters ourselves. It doesn't seem that far away. Are your legs okay?
Dialog_Action_990700258_9,"They're fine thanks to this Power Suit, but I won't be so lucky if I get hit again."
Dialog_Action_990700259_1,Proctor! We're glad to see you! We have encountered some tough enemies here!
Dialog_Action_990700259_2,We also encountered a lot of problems. It's great to meet with friendly faces. Who is this enemy you speak of?
Dialog_Action_990700259_3,"They're right ahead! They are not local, but they seem to be hunting someone and they are not friendly toward us. We tried to stop them from running around in our territory, but they attacked us!"
Dialog_Action_990700259_4,It looks like we have to defeat them first to safely return to headquarters. Let's fight together to drive the outsiders back! I brought you the supplies from the Vertibird. They might be useful!
Dialog_Action_990700259_5,"Thanks for your help, Proctor! However, our problem still persists. This group of outsiders took advantage of us fighting the Enclave and have been here a long time. Also, these humanoid creatures... are just products of technology."
Dialog_Action_990700259_6,Products of technology again?! We cannot let them threaten our safety from behind us!
Dialog_Action_990700259_7,"We have brothers who went to find their base, but we lost signal as soon as they entered. Proctor, please come with us to lend them support!"
Dialog_Action_990700259_8,Ad victoriam!
Dialog_Action_990700260_1,"They actually live underground and sleep during the day, just like rats."
Dialog_Action_990700260_2,"Their camps are very well concealed, and there might be traps around. From the gunshots we are hearing, our men might be fighting with them inside."
Dialog_Action_990700260_3,"Let's be careful and not trigger the traps. Danse, you guard the door, and I will go in to investigate!"
Dialog_Action_990700260_4,Maxson! Why are you here? Sarah should have left you in a safe place!
Dialog_Action_990700260_5,"Don't treat me like a kid, Proctor! I have proven that I'm an excellent warrior!"
Dialog_Action_990700260_6,Your safety matters to the Brotherhood!
Dialog_Action_990700260_7,"I can protect myself, Proctor. At this moment, this group of self-proclaimed Institute scientists poses a greater threat to the Brotherhood! Did you see their Synths? They're almost exactly the same as humans! But they are all controlled by the Institute. Once they infiltrate the Brotherhood, we might be divided by them from within!"
Dialog_Action_990700260_8,"You're right, Maxson."
Dialog_Action_990700260_9,Then let us destroy them!
Dialog_Action_990700260_10,Cowards! They ran away!
Dialog_Action_990700260_11,"Let's go after them! Maxson, you go back!"
Dialog_Action_990700260_12,No! I'll go with you!
Dialog_Action_990700261_1,"Stop! You're already on the edge of the cliff, and you have no way to escape now!"
Dialog_Action_990700261_2,You barbarians! We are here just minding our own business!
Dialog_Action_990700261_3,Stop yapping! The technology you have mastered is threatening the world! This isn't just your own business!
Dialog_Action_990700261_4,We promise not to mess around in your territory. Please let us take these deserters back. We'll never cross paths again!
Dialog_Action_990700261_5,The Brotherhood won't negotiate with you. Attack!
Dialog_Action_990700261_6,"You're persistent, but you didn't expect that we would have a back-up plan. Bye! (Teleports away)"
Dialog_Action_990700261_7,Damn it! What is this? Where have they gone?!
Dialog_Action_990700261_8,Be careful! They left a Fat Man! Retreat!
Dialog_Action_990700261_9,Aaaaargh!
Dialog_Action_990700262_1,"Chase, have you reached the designated location?"
Dialog_Action_990700262_2,"Yes, Father. I am close to the target, and I am about to commence capture."
Dialog_Action_990700262_3,"The enemies this time aren't stragglers, but a group of Synths. They have occupied a factory and are producing Synths to fight us."
Dialog_Action_990700262_4,It doesn't matter. I only need to capture their leader.
Dialog_Action_990700262_5,"That would be for the best. Chase, you never let us down."
Dialog_Action_990700262_6,"Yes, Father, not this time either."
Dialog_Action_990700262_7,"I didn't expect them to have produced so many Gen I Synths. It seems like this group of defected Synths know the structure of Synths well. I can't take the risk a head-on confrontation, so I'd better make a detour if I spot any powerful enemies."
Dialog_Action_990700262_8,"My target is just their boss, not anyone else."
Dialog_Action_990700262_9,It's over! Put down your weapons!
Dialog_Action_990700262_10,"It's Chase! You go first, I'll stall him!"
Dialog_Action_990700262_11,Hah! Naive! Where do you find the guts to escape?!
Dialog_Action_990700262_12,"Give me liberty or give me death! You bootlickers will never understand us. Only a free Synth can control his own destiny. Otherwise, you will always be just a number!"
Dialog_Action_990700262_13,"Okay, the trouble is resolved. I'd like to see where else he can go."
Dialog_Action_990700263_1,"They didn't escape but gathered together. What a surprise! I thought they escaped in order to survive, but it turns out that they are not afraid of death."
Dialog_Action_990700263_2,"But no matter how many Brahmins there are, they will still be chased down by the demonic bears. Since they gathered together, it'll save me the effort of chasing them down one by one."
Dialog_Action_990700263_3,"Fortunately, I prepared a special weapon, so I'll kill some Synths from a distance first before I find the target."
Dialog_Action_990700263_4,It's Chase the hunter! She's already here! We must stop her!
Dialog_Action_990700263_5,I didn't expect you to have the courage to fight me. Don't you usually hide in the sewers like radroaches?
Dialog_Action_990700263_6,We are not doing this for survival! We are doing this for freedom! You'll never know the joy of freedom! You can't kill us all!
Dialog_Action_990700263_7,Do you think you will always be a hunter? Do you think the Institute will never abandon you?
Dialog_Action_990700263_8,"When the time comes, let's see who will stand up for you. When you understand what freedom is, will you make the same choice as us? You think you are a hunter now, but in actual fact, you are just a dog to the Institute, just like us!"
Dialog_Action_990700263_9,"Is freedom really so important? It is worth betraying the Institute for? Heh, as long as I carry out my duty faithfully, the Institute will never abandon me. Moreover, I am now not only in control of my own life, I can also take away yours!"
Dialog_Action_990700264_1,"Hah! Look at this messy place, he definitely took a rest here and ran away in a hurry after being discovered."
Dialog_Action_990700264_2,"He's already in a panic, even if he's protected by Synths. How pathetic."
Dialog_Action_990700264_3,No rush. He must be here. He has no way to escape!
Dialog_Action_990700264_4,"Let's do it as always. Avoid the tough ones, and directly eliminate the srap metal so we can finally wrap this up here!"
Dialog_Action_990700264_5,Chase! I was expecting you!
Dialog_Action_990700264_6,Are you surprised to see me?
Dialog_Action_990700264_7,"Hah. Not surprised at all, because I was once a hunter too!"
Dialog_Action_990700264_8,"As a hunter, how could you betray the Institute?! I'll punish you on behalf of the Institute today!"
Dialog_Action_990700264_9,"Haha, Chase... Do you really think that you won't become the next me? I can choose to die if I wanted to, but your life is determined by the Institute."
Dialog_Action_990700264_10,"As your last words, this isn't funny at all."
Dialog_Action_990700264_11,"Believe me, no matter how much you have done, the Institute will abandon you over just one trifle issue. Only after you are free can you control your own fate."
Dialog_Action_990700264_12,"Well, mission completed. It's time to teleport back to the Institute!"
Dialog_Action_990700265_1,Wait! What happened! Why is this happening!
Dialog_Action_990700265_2,"Hunter Chase, traitor of the Institute! You brought back a fake chip and spread a virus. You'll be eliminated!"
Dialog_Action_990700265_3,I didn't! I just completed the mission! I didn't betray the Institute!
Dialog_Action_990700265_4,Kill the traitor! Kill the traitor!
Dialog_Action_990700265_5,Damn it! Why is this happening! No wonder that guy looked so proud even on the brink of his death!
Dialog_Action_990700265_6,"The Institute regards me as a traitor... Damn it! They were right! I'm just a tool of the Institute, a thug, and the Institute doesn't care about what I accomplished previously! Only free Synths have worth and can control their own destiny!"
Dialog_Action_990700265_7,"I need to escape from the Institute... No... If I can get the weapons hidden by the Institute, I might be able to destroy many Synth guards..."
Dialog_Action_990700265_8,"Since the Institute was so heartless, they can't blame me for fighting back! I'll also control my own destiny!"
Dialog_Action_990700265_9,I thought the Institute treated me differently.
Dialog_Action_990700265_10,"But it turns out that the Institute treats all Synths the same... We are all slaves, and the Institute will abandon us at will... Only when I'm free can I be myself!"
Dialog_Action_990700265_11,"From now on, I'll be the only one that can control my life!"
Dialog_Action_990700266_1,"The place ahead is the warehouse that manages the Synths, and there are many Synths in it."
Dialog_Action_990700266_2,"Many defected Synths are still imprisoned here, and now I'll give them the same freedom."
Dialog_Action_990700266_3,"The Institute can't take my life, and I'll even take away something from the Institute as compensation for my hard work these years!"
Dialog_Action_990700266_4,Found a defected hunter! Attack!
Dialog_Action_990700266_5,"Okay, it's safe now. Everyone, you're free now."
Dialog_Action_990700266_6,We are free... But where should we go? Can the Railroad help so many of us?
Dialog_Action_990700266_7,"We can find a place to hide... Or, we can also occupy a factory."
Dialog_Action_990700266_8,"Wait, I received a signal... from... Far Harbor?"
Dialog_Action_990700267_1,"Kellogg... I'll always remember his name, so that I can engrave it on his tombstone... If he still has a body when he dies!"
Dialog_Action_990700267_2,"I already know where you are, Kellogg. You can't hide from me anymore."
Dialog_Action_990700267_3,"Nick and Dogmeat helped me find you. According to the map, I just need to cross the bridge to the west bank of the river, and walk through a forest to Fort Hagen, there I will find him."
Dialog_Action_990700267_4,"As long as I can complete this last leg, I'll find him... But before that, I need to pass through this Red Rocket Truck Stop filled with ghouls."
Dialog_Action_990700267_5,"Fortunately, I found this Fat Man launcher, but I need to pay attention to my ammo at all times."
Dialog_Action_990700267_6,"Okay, next I have to cross this bridge to get to the west of the city..."
Dialog_Action_990700267_7,It's not wise to use nuclear bombs on the bridge. Let me scout around and see if there are better weapons to use in my backpack.
Dialog_Action_990700268_1,It's another bridge occupied by gunmen.
Dialog_Action_990700268_2,"Unlike in the wild, the bridge is a narrow place where I have no place to hide, and there is no way to go around. Also, there are a lot of gunmen..."
Dialog_Action_990700268_3,Don't make any loud noises. The sniper rifle will be most suitable with its one shot kills. The enemies on the bridge also have no way to sneak up behind us.
Dialog_Action_990700268_4,"I have limited bullets, so I'll need to pick up some along the way. If I run out of my ammo, I'll have to attack them head-on. No matter what, I must kill Kellogg!"
Dialog_Action_990700268_5,"After eliminating the gunmen, I'll be one more step closer to Kellogg."
Dialog_Action_990700268_6,"Next, I need to go through a forest. Past the forest, I'll be able to reach Kellogg's hideout. He must know where Shaun is!"
Dialog_Action_990700268_7,"Even if it has been sixty years, I will bring my son home!"
Dialog_Action_990700269_1,This forest... I have a bad feeling about it.
Dialog_Action_990700269_2,"Hmm... This are the footprints of a demonic bear. This is an extremely ferocious beast. If I'm not careful, I might become its prey."
Dialog_Action_990700269_3,"Since I'm in the forest, I can either use the powerful Fat Man, or hide in the trees and be an accurate hunter."
Dialog_Action_990700269_4,"But no matter what method I use, I'll have to get through this forest. But before that, I need to find the map at the checkpoint."
Dialog_Action_990700269_5,Hah! Look what I found on the map! On the horizon there is a gray concrete-roofed building.
Dialog_Action_990700269_6,Fort Hagen is the place where that coward has been hiding for sixty years!
Dialog_Action_990700269_7,Look at this gray reinforced concrete building. It happens to be a murderer's coffin!
Dialog_Action_990700269_8,"Shaun, just wait a little longer. Dad is coming to save you."
Dialog_Action_990700270_1,"Kellogg! Don't think about running away! Do you think that you're protecting yourself by locking the front door? You have locked yourself here, just like how I was locked in the life-sustaining cabin by you!"
Dialog_Action_990700270_2,"I'm sorry that your house was destroyed 200 years ago, but I don't need a roommate now. Go away!"
Dialog_Action_990700270_3,"Oh, Kellogg! It seems llike you still remember me. That's good, let me help you recall what you did before!"
Dialog_Action_990700270_4,Do you think these metal toys can stop me? Let me show you the cryolator I specially prepared! Can your toys stand against this gun?
Dialog_Action_990700270_5,You can't escape any longer! Kellogg!
Dialog_Action_990700270_6,"Okay, well, I have to admit that you're really something."
Dialog_Action_990700270_7,"You did it, but please calm down first. Let me turn off the Synth alarm system and let's have a chat."
Dialog_Action_990700270_8,There are Synths near Kellogg... It seems that he does have something to do with the Institute that the people in Diamond City were talking about.
Dialog_Action_990700270_9,"So can it be said that the real culprit behind Kellogg is the Institute? I thought that what Piper said was false, but it turns out that the Institute really kidnaps people!"
Dialog_Action_990700270_10,I need to hear the truth from Kellogg!
Dialog_Action_990700271_1,Kellogg! You kidnapping freak! Give my son back to me! Hurry!
Dialog_Action_990700271_2,"If you're here for a happy reunion, then you will be disappointed. Your son is not with me."
Dialog_Action_990700271_3,Where is he then?!
Dialog_Action_990700271_4,"He is in a comfortable and safe place where he is well taken care of. Yes, you've guessed it. It's the Institute."
Dialog_Action_990700271_5,The Institute... I will find him! I will find the Institute!
Dialog_Action_990700271_6,"Hah! It won't be you who finds the Institute. It'll be the Institute finding you. Before that, we should settle this matter between us. Are you ready for that?"
Dialog_Action_990700271_7,"Sure! Today, you'll pay for everything you have done!"
Dialog_Action_990700271_8,Ah... It finally comes to the end.
Dialog_Action_990700271_9,"Do you think you've gotten your revenge? All this is part of the plan, and both you and me are just puppets. I was just on a bigger stage, that's all..."
Dialog_Action_990700271_10,Good! Now you scum can no longer harm other people.
Dialog_Action_990700271_11,"The Institute... No matter where they are, I'll go rescue my son."
Dialog_Action_990700271_12,Maybe... Nick will have some clues?
Dialog_Action_990700272_1,Gunshots ahead!
Dialog_Action_990700272_2,Damn Zorbo! It's you again! Aren't you bored staying on Earth?!
Dialog_Action_990700272_3,"Haha, the fool and his monkey! Do you think I learned human language and named myself a human name to date you? It's because I have no choice!"
Dialog_Action_990700272_4,I will not allow you to return to the universe!
Dialog_Action_990700272_5,Then bring it on! Try to break through my loyal guards' defense!
Dialog_Action_990700272_6,"Ahh! Damn! Jangles, retreat!"
Dialog_Action_990700272_7,Ha! Brave young man! Are you willing to save the Earth?
Dialog_Action_990700272_8,"Who are you? Argh, no! What are you?"
Dialog_Action_990700272_9,I'm a human! Do I look like Monkey and the green man?
Dialog_Action_990700272_10,Don't you think it's weird for a human to dress like this on earth?
Dialog_Action_990700272_11,"Well, you're right, I have not seen humans for a long time, and forgot how to dress like one. I have not seen humans for a long time and forgotten. As you can see, the only ones I meet are Jangles and the weirdos before me!"
Dialog_Action_990700272_12,Alright. What Bottle & Cap said is correct. He is indeed a lunatic.
Dialog_Action_990700272_13,"Ahh! They're coming! If you don't want to be dissected by aliens, hurry up and fight them!"
Dialog_Action_990700272_14,"You're awesome! With your help, I believe that I will break through these guards and defeat Zorbo."
Dialog_Action_990700272_15,"Don't look at me like that! I didn't lie to you! If I can't defeat Zorbo, Earth will be in danger!"
Dialog_Action_990700272_16,Really? I thought the Earth was already in danger.
Dialog_Action_990700272_17,"Worse than it is now! Zorbo is an evil alien, he wants to eliminate all creatures on earth and make it into his colony!"
Dialog_Action_990700272_18,"I tried to stop him, but he blocked the road and had his robots to guard it. With just me and Jangles we don't stand a chance, so I need your help!"
Dialog_Action_990700272_19,"Zorbo has collected a lot of things in his lab. As long as you help me defeat Zorbo, I'll give those things to you!"
Dialog_Action_990700273_1,"Zorbo used the equipment here to produce a lot of robots, and they will prevent us from breaking through the roadblock."
Dialog_Action_990700273_2,You must eliminate Zorbo's robots first. Here is our starting point.
Dialog_Action_990700273_3,"Before, Jangles and I didn't have enough firepower, but with you, we can now do it!"
Dialog_Action_990700273_4,Follow me! For Earth!!
Dialog_Action_990700273_5,Good job! You made it!
Dialog_Action_990700273_6,We need to stop Zorbo's conspiracy! Follow me! I'll tell you Zorbo's secrets on the way!
Dialog_Action_990700274_1,You mean... Zorbo is a evil alien doctor who is trying to take over Earth?
Dialog_Action_990700274_2,"Yes, he has had his eye on Earth for a long time. Earth is a mild planet suitable for life. It happens that human beings are fighting with each other, so he decided to take the chance to eliminate all of mankind!"
Dialog_Action_990700274_3,"I once defeated him in a spaceship outside the Earth, but I didn't think he was still alive, hiding here."
Dialog_Action_990700274_4,"I searched for a long time before I spotted him. At that time, he began producing a robot army with the equipment here."
Dialog_Action_990700274_5,"He kept capturing Raiders and using them to study the human body. If we don't stop him, Earth will be in danger!"
Dialog_Action_990700274_6,"Well, it seems that the condition of these two people are more serious than we thought."
Dialog_Action_990700274_7,"However, everything is possible in this park."
Dialog_Action_990700274_8,"Anyway, as long as I can make a profit."
Dialog_Action_990700275_1,Zorbo! Today is your last day! My comrades from Earth and I will stop you!
Dialog_Action_990700275_2,"Hah, I thought that no one likes you except your monkey. Poor human! You chose the wrong ally."
Dialog_Action_990700275_3,"I don't care about your allies, but I can help you find a doctor for when I am done with you."
Dialog_Action_990700275_4,"Hah, you're so considerate, but I won't get hurt!"
Dialog_Action_990700275_5,...Alright! As long as you are happy.
Dialog_Action_990700275_6,Ridiculous human! Arrogant human beings! Let me show you lowlifes the power from beyond this little planet!
Dialog_Action_990700275_7,"That's all? Zorbo, I defeated you in space, and I can also defeat you here!"
Dialog_Action_990700275_8,"Hahaha! Captain Cosmos, you are smart as your monkey! Do you think you'd get me without fighting?!"
Dialog_Action_990700275_9,I don't care what you are going to do! Now I will kill you!
Dialog_Action_990700275_10,Naive! Have you forgotten something? I can run away anytime!
Dialog_Action_990700275_11,Haha! Your spaceship has crashed. You have no way to escape now!
Dialog_Action_990700275_12,"My spacecraft has crashed, but your spacecraft is still there! Do you think I studied nothing except poison? I've unlocked your spaceship's security system and door! Adios, Captain Cosmos, oh no, you'll be Captain Earth from now on!"
Dialog_Action_990700275_13,What?! Stop him!
Dialog_Action_990700275_14,Damn! He got away!
Dialog_Action_990700275_15,Don't stand there gawking! Go back to my spaceship and stop him!
Dialog_Action_990700276_1,Zorbo! You'll never get away!
Dialog_Action_990700276_2,Damn! I just found the energy you hid!
Dialog_Action_990700276_3,This is the last thing you can do on Earth!
Dialog_Action_990700276_4,Ha! Let's see who will be the lucky one this time!
Dialog_Action_990700276_5,They are quite involved in the performance. I'm a little bit nervous now.
Dialog_Action_990700276_6,Ugh......Captain Cosmos ......you think that's the end of it? !
Dialog_Action_990700276_7,Of course! You have no way to escape now!
Dialog_Action_990700276_8,You will not have a chance to commit sins on other planets!
Dialog_Action_990700276_9,(Boom!)
Dialog_Action_990700276_10,Ahh! !
Dialog_Action_990700276_11,Thanks for your help! Jangles and I are very grateful to you!
Dialog_Action_990700276_12,"As what I said, everything in this playground is yours now."
Dialog_Action_990700276_13,"I'll go back to space to stop a greater trouble from happening and maintain justice! Goodbye, my comrades! Jangles the Moon Monkey and I will miss you!"
Dialog_Action_990700276_14,(Taking off)
Dialog_Action_990700276_15,What?! This is a real spaceship?!
Dialog_Action_990700276_16,That alien...
Dialog_Action_990700276_17,This is real! Is all this real?! Are they crazy or me?!
Dialog_Action_990700276_18,Perhaps it was me that needed a doctor.
Dialog_Action_990700276_19,"Ha! Stupid Captain Cosmos, how could I find the fuel myself."
Dialog_Action_990700276_20,"Thanks for taking me back to space, I'm leaving using the escape pod! I'll be back!"
Dialog_Action_990700277_1,"Irma, we have a big problem."
Dialog_Action_990700277_2,"You're just in time, Dr. Amari, there's been a big problem with the memory bank lately! Many people complained that the memories they saw were not theirs!"
Dialog_Action_990700277_3,"Yes, Irma, that's the problem I wanted to talk about, we have a problem with the database."
Dialog_Action_990700277_4,"Before you freak out, I do have good news, I've taken care of the fundamental problem."
Dialog_Action_990700277_5,"Whew, that's awesome, hon. I'm proud of you! No we don't need to shut down the business."
Dialog_Action_990700277_6,"Not really, the bad news is, there are still many minor issues out there."
Dialog_Action_990700277_7,What minor issues?
Dialog_Action_990700277_8,"Simply speaking, there is a bias in some people's memory, some false memory fragments were not deleted."
Dialog_Action_990700277_9,"You are accountable for what you say, you know that, right? So what shall we do to fix it?"
Dialog_Action_990700277_10,"It requires someone to get into the stages and remove the fragments one by one. Unfortunately, you will be the one to complete it as the one in blue has not been in Goodneighbor for a while."
Dialog_Action_990700277_11,No worries. I'll help behind the scenes. You'll be given the items for fixing memories when the time comes. It's simple and safe.
Dialog_Action_990700277_12,Why me! Why send a lady on such a dangerous mission!?!?
Dialog_Action_990700277_13,We have no one else. Or would you rather extract the memories while I go in?
Dialog_Action_990700277_14,.... I hope it is not going to be dangerous.
Dialog_Action_990700277_15,"Pay attention to the perfume you have on hand.  In order not to spoil the integrity of the memory, I chose something that wouldn't look out of place. Otherwise, the machine will detect a huge error and delete you along with the memories."
Dialog_Action_990700277_16,"There's one thing you should know! The perfume is seductive to men and can make them drop their guard, but it's a mockery to women, so never let a woman in the memory smell on you."
Dialog_Action_990700277_17,"That's all you need to be aware of. Be careful, I don't know what will happen if you get hurt in the memory! Make good use of your perfume to deal with the enemies inside the memory!"
Dialog_Action_990700277_18,"Good Irma, you have removed the first false memory fragment."
Dialog_Action_990700277_19,We will be able to remove the rest of the memory fragments quickly then.
Dialog_Action_990700278_1,Whose memory is this? It appears to be inside a very spacious building.
Dialog_Action_990700278_2,I smell the stench of the Raiders. Who the hell is so close to them!
Dialog_Action_990700278_3,I can smell the blood in the air. Maybe this is a Raider hunter.
Dialog_Action_990700278_4,I'm sure Miss Cait likes me!
Dialog_Action_990700278_5,Bull crap! Miss Cait just hit me with her bat yesterday. She didn't even hit anyone else! I'm sure she likes me!
Dialog_Action_990700278_6,"Ahh! I have smelled Miss Cait’s perfume, ah, I can't help to kneel before her......"
Dialog_Action_990700278_7,Ahh! Damn Cait! She comes every day to beat up our men! But the men are still swooning over her. Look at them!
Dialog_Action_990700278_8,Ugh! Don’t fall for her tricks! Waves the baseball bat every day to seduce our men. I'll beat her up if I meet her again!
Dialog_Action_990700278_9,Hold on! What is that smell in the air! Is she coming again!?!?
Dialog_Action_990700278_10,Better not to deal with these women ...... the memory is so disorganized.
Dialog_Action_990700278_11,"Phew, it's finally over. Is this Cait's memory or the memory of someone killed by Cait?"
Dialog_Action_990700278_12,This memory is absolutely disgusting! Whose memory will be next?
Dialog_Action_990700279_1,"Wait, what's this place? Seems to be a warehouse."
Dialog_Action_990700279_2,What are you doing there? Take the stuff and go. Remember why we dug all the way to get into this cave in the first place!
Dialog_Action_990700279_3,"Wait, are you Hancock? !"
Dialog_Action_990700279_4,You don't say! Goodneighbor Mayor Bobbie? Stop talking nonsense. Just move on!
Dialog_Action_990700279_5,Wow...... this memory error seems surprising......
Dialog_Action_990700279_6,"Be careful, the noise must have been noticed, we're dead men if we get caught. Any ideas how to keep away from the guards?"
Dialog_Action_990700279_7,I found some ropes. Let’s use them to avoid the guards.
Dialog_Action_990700279_8,We've made it! These things are enough to last the rest of my life!
Dialog_Action_990700279_9,Let's split the treasure......
Dialog_Action_990700279_10,"Nah, I don't want them. They're all yours."
Dialog_Action_990700279_11,Are you out of your mind?!?!
Dialog_Action_990700279_12,"It's just a dream anyway, so it will be useless."
Dialog_Action_990700279_13,"What nonsense are you talking about? Your the one who said it, so keep your word!"
Dialog_Action_990700279_14,"Alas, is this Hancock's dream or Bobbie's dream?"
Dialog_Action_990700280_1,Let’s see where we are this time. Is this... Diamond City?
Dialog_Action_990700280_2,Finally a normal place.
Dialog_Action_990700280_3,Whoa! Is this man...dead?...
Dialog_Action_990700280_4,No...but I'm dying...
Dialog_Action_990700280_5,Umm...do you want me to find a doctor for you? I remember that there is a good doctor in Diamond City!
Dialog_Action_990700280_6,It's too late! You! Would you help me? That damned Institute robot! He abducted my kid!
Dialog_Action_990700280_7,Your kid?!?
Dialog_Action_990700280_8,Yes! Hurry! He's taking my kid back to the teleportation portal! Please do save my kid!
Dialog_Action_990700280_9,All right.
Dialog_Action_990700280_10,"You are really a nice person, I just regret that...I don't have anything to pay you..."
Dialog_Action_990700280_11,Doesn't matter. It's just a dream anyway.
Dialog_Action_990700280_12,Stay away from our business! Don't stand in the way of the Institute! Woman!
Dialog_Action_990700280_13,"Wait, is this the kid you brought with you?"
Dialog_Action_990700280_14,Whoa! Whoa!
Dialog_Action_990700280_15,It's making me throw up ...
Dialog_Action_990700280_16,"I repeat, get out of the way, woman!"
Dialog_Action_990700280_17,"Alright, it's time to check if this perfume works on male robots!"
Dialog_Action_990700280_18,"Yes, little blue kid, you're safe now."
Dialog_Action_990700280_19,Mum! Mum!
Dialog_Action_990700280_20,I...Amari! Get me out! It's gross!
Dialog_Action_990700281_1,I'm becoming somewhat uncomfortable with these strange nightmares.
Dialog_Action_990700281_2,This is...Ecchhh Acchhhh! Boohoo! (In the water!!)
Dialog_Action_990700281_3,Boohoo Boohoo! Ecchhh Acchhhh! (Amari! I need an oxygen mask!)
Dialog_Action_990700281_4,Ecchhh Acchhhh! (Damn! I'm not going to drown in my dreams!)
Dialog_Action_990700281_5,"Hello everyone! Thank you for listening to The Mobula on Mobula Channel! Today, our hero Mobula is going to fight again in Goodneighbor!"
Dialog_Action_990700281_6,Ecchhh Acchhhh! (Isn't that the freaking ghoul? Who's the hero Mobula by the way?)
Dialog_Action_990700281_7,"Today, several men were killed again in Goodneighbor, there was a card written by the Silver Killer on each of their bodies."
Dialog_Action_990700281_8,The news of this incident scared the townsfolk. This demon seeks out his prey every night and leaves a card to challenge our hero Mobula.
Dialog_Action_990700281_9,The great hero Mobula! Will fight the Silver Killer for justice again!
Dialog_Action_990700281_10,The story on this radio station is getting more and more ridiculous.
Dialog_Action_990700281_11,Silver Killer! Your crimes stop here!
Dialog_Action_990700281_12,Ha! You stinky fish! No way you can beat me!
Dialog_Action_990700281_13,Haha! Mobula! Surprise! The mole on your side is actually me!
Dialog_Action_990700281_14,"What?! Kent, how dare you betray me!"
Dialog_Action_990700281_15,I was a fan of Silver Killer from the start! Die Mobula!
Dialog_Action_990700281_16,Ahh!!
Dialog_Action_990700281_17,"Ecchhh Acchhhh! (This plot is much more interesting than ones in the past. Are you alright, Mobula?)"
Dialog_Action_990700281_18,What?! A woman came out from nowhere?
Dialog_Action_990700281_19,It's a woman after all! Kill her!
Dialog_Action_990700281_20,"Oh! Pretty lady, you saved my life!"
Dialog_Action_990700281_21,Ecchhh Acchhhh! (Oops! Mobula looks cute!)
Dialog_Action_990700281_22,"Lady, you are my pearl!"
Dialog_Action_990700281_23,"Ecchhh Acchhhh! (That's nice and romantic. Whose dream is this?Is it Kent's?) Are you alright, Mobula?)"
Dialog_Action_990700281_24,"Chill out Irma, it's yours! I didn't think you were that girlish."
Dialog_Action_990700281_25,Ecchhh Acchhhh! !
Dialog_Action_990700282_1,"Today, we stand here, on the wasteland where people are struggling."
Dialog_Action_990700282_2,"Once this land was devastated by nuclear bombs, now it is struggling to survive under the gnawing group of moths."
Dialog_Action_990700282_3,"There are monsters everywhere, as well as evil Raiders. Many have yielded to the devil, but we will not."
Dialog_Action_990700282_4,"Now, in here, we will fire the first shot to guard the people in Quincy! Brave warriors! It is time to fight back against evil!"
Dialog_Action_990700282_5,"But we don't have adequate weapons, General!"
Dialog_Action_990700282_6,"No worries, warriors. I've got some cheap weapons for you. See this wine bottle?"
Dialog_Action_990700282_7,This is not wine inside but radioactive dust and psychedelics. No one will be able to hold their ground against this poison.
Dialog_Action_990700282_8,"It's true. We have no good weapons, but the Raiders against us do. They will be our weapons depot!"
Dialog_Action_990700282_9,Ha! This is our first win over here!
Dialog_Action_990700282_10,"General McGann's cocktail is pretty useful, it's a really good weapon!"
Dialog_Action_990700282_11,"Then let our enemies have a good taste of it, but we have to abstain from alcohol, soldiers."
Dialog_Action_990700282_12,Wine will corrupt your mind. It will ruin you if you get addicted to it!
Dialog_Action_990700283_1,"Soldiers, we are now going to take this area, which was a pre-war warehouse where Raiders hoarded their unjust gains."
Dialog_Action_990700283_2,They have a lot of food and weapons stored here. This will strengthen the minutemen greatly if we take it..
Dialog_Action_990700283_3,"The Raiders are just a bunch of pests, they are numerous, but we have more bottles for them!"
Dialog_Action_990700283_4,Make sure to do your best to finish them off! !
Dialog_Action_990700283_5,"Ha! Peasants can't be soldiers anyway, even they have weapons!"
Dialog_Action_990700283_6,"Ha! You cowards, you don’t think you can dominate the wasteland just because you're armed do you?"
Dialog_Action_990700283_7,You're no different from us. Aren't you guys here for this stuff too? We'll share some with you. Then you can get the hell out!
Dialog_Action_990700283_8,"You're wrong! It's the people of the wasteland that need them, not us! Kill them all!"
Dialog_Action_990700283_9,"General McGann, look what we have here! Food, ammunition, and gallons of Amontillado! These are all pre-war goods. Quite well preserved!"
Dialog_Action_990700283_10,"Good, get the weapons and food packed! As for the wine...Let me think..."
Dialog_Action_990700283_11,Why not let everyone have some fun? For the big win.
Dialog_Action_990700283_12,"Well, just this one time, but let me have a taste of it first ..."
Dialog_Action_990700284_1,General McGann! Ronnie Shaw was attacked by some gunmen on her way back from recon!
Dialog_Action_990700284_2,She’s being held captive at the gunmen camp! Their boss wants money to set her free!
Dialog_Action_990700284_3,"The Minutemen will not negotiate with mercenaries! They will realize they have messed with the wrong people. Soldiers, let’s get her out of there!"
Dialog_Action_990700284_4,"Shaw, are you all right?"
Dialog_Action_990700284_5,No worries. I was attacked while unprepared! Where is everyone else?
Dialog_Action_990700284_6,"Let's go save them. When this is over, let's grab some drinks together."
Dialog_Action_990700284_7,Ha! These gunmen are no match for us!
Dialog_Action_990700284_8,"Another great victory! Soldiers, let's all have a good drink tonight to celebrate the return of our heroes!"
Dialog_Action_990700284_9,"General, you've been drinking too much lately. That's not good!"
Dialog_Action_990700284_10,Come on! It's for the celebration. Just this time. I promise.
Dialog_Action_990700284_11,Fine...General.
Dialog_Action_990700285_1,"This is the place we're talking about, General. There are no enemies inside but a bunch of Mirelurks are."
Dialog_Action_990700285_2,This place is easy to defend with an open view. It's a suitable base!
Dialog_Action_990700285_3,"You're right Shaw, it is."
Dialog_Action_990700285_4,"It's just a bunch of Mirelurks. Soldiers, take this castle and make it our base!"
Dialog_Action_990700285_5,"Good, this place is ours now! Build defensive fortifications and construct buildings here!"
Dialog_Action_990700285_6,Oh! This armory is very well preserved! The castle is intact and it's the perfect base for us to save the entire wasteland!
Dialog_Action_990700285_7,"From now on, all the Minutemens’ efforts will focus on protecting the people of the wasteland!"
Dialog_Action_990700285_8,Seal all this wine and we will drink again when we return peace to the wasteland!
Dialog_Action_990700286_1,"Uh...uh...how is...Uh, why can't I...feel anything..."
Dialog_Action_990700286_2,Oh..where am I now...
Dialog_Action_990700286_3,Where...where is everyone...Shaw!
Dialog_Action_990700286_4,Oh...damn...what is all this...what...oh right...there are enemies attacking us! Enemy attack!
Dialog_Action_990700286_5,Shaw! Shaw! I have locked the armory. Don't let the gunmen take our cannons! ! Shaw!
Dialog_Action_990700286_6,General! General! Open the door! General! It's a giant Mirelurk queen out there! We need weapons! General! !
Dialog_Action_990700286_7,Huh?...what...open what ...huh? This door won't open!
Dialog_Action_990700286_8,General! Wake up! General!
Dialog_Action_990700286_9,I can't open it! Damn! The gate is blocked by something! I can't get out! Shaw! I can't get out!
Dialog_Action_990700286_10,Mirelurk...Mirelurk...why so many...Mirelurks...
Dialog_Action_990700286_11,Shaw! Clint! Soldiers! Soldiers!!!
Dialog_Action_990700286_12,No!!!
Dialog_Action_990700287_1,Never thought a Khajiit could fight together with a dragon!
Dialog_Action_990700287_2,Hoo-hoo!
Dialog_Action_990700287_3,"Where is this place, you ask? Hard to explain...Just remember, you're not from this place."
Dialog_Action_990700287_4,"Of course, we will investigate as much as possible in order to send you back. Khajiit has to find a way to go back anyway."
Dialog_Action_990700287_5,"""Ow-wooo""!"
Dialog_Action_990700287_6,Whoa! Isn't that a goblin? ! Why is there a goblin here? !
Dialog_Action_990700287_7,Help me!
Dialog_Action_990700287_8,"Odd, why are there kobolds here? Is it because we didn't clean up the previous monsters?"
Dialog_Action_990700287_9,But where exactly are there goblins hiding? Mount Mabel is not suitable for them to survive.
Dialog_Action_990700287_10,Lucky that they left footprints. We could follow and see what went wrong.
Dialog_Action_990700287_11,"If it's some inexplicable teleportation array again, Saashi should be able to return to the Tamriel continent! Now I feel like the goblins over there are cuter than the ghouls here."
Dialog_Action_990700288_1,Whoa! I am surprised there are actually so many goblins here!
Dialog_Action_990700288_2,So they came out from this cave! Could it be that they have been hiding in the cave so we didn't notice them before?
Dialog_Action_990700288_3,"It could be that these idiots didn't listen to me and continued digging for treasure, which gave the goblins the chance to come out!"
Dialog_Action_990700288_4,Squeak squeak squeak! !
Dialog_Action_990700288_5,Hoo-hoo! !
Dialog_Action_990700288_6,What?! You said there were a lot of them?
Dialog_Action_990700288_7,"Well, let's see how many they are."
Dialog_Action_990700289_1,Whoa! Didn't realize they all had camped on the ground with so many goblins and irradiated creatures! ! We shouldn't have ventured in.
Dialog_Action_990700289_2,"Shh, keep your voice down! Don't wake them up! Let's find an exit and leave."
Dialog_Action_990700289_3,Hoo-hoo! !
Dialog_Action_990700289_4,Squeak squeak! ! Squeak squeak! ! !
Dialog_Action_990700289_5,......
Dialog_Action_990700289_6,Is the dragon simple-minded like the goblins?
Dialog_Action_990700289_7,"Yes, we finally made it out of the goblin location..."
Dialog_Action_990700289_8,Alas! Hold on a second! There's an odd light over there! I can feel magic coming out of it!
Dialog_Action_990700289_9,"Time is short, but we must explore the places with magic!"
Dialog_Action_990700290_1,"Saashi has warned you before that this cave is unstable, yet you simply did not listen! How much did you dig up!?!?"
Dialog_Action_990700290_2,It's a misunderstanding. All dwellers of the Republic of Dave can testify that it was not us that found these green monsters!
Dialog_Action_990700290_3,"Saashi, you mean that after we teleported the mountain away, there was another teleportation array down there?"
Dialog_Action_990700290_4,"Saashi was not sure before we went down, but it is possible that they were hidden underground before."
Dialog_Action_990700290_5,"Therefore, we must investigate and not let these monsters run rampant in our world."
Dialog_Action_990700290_6,I guess these little guys are not that dangerous to Mount Mabel as this dragon is. I'd like to investigate where they came from.
Dialog_Action_990700290_7,? (Head tilted)
Dialog_Action_990700290_8,It was hatched from the dragon egg that was left in here before and just escaped from the goblins.
Dialog_Action_990700290_9,Well...do you have an idea how to send it back?
Dialog_Action_990700290_10,"Not for now, but I will come up with one if indeed these goblins were teleported here."
Dialog_Action_990700290_11,"Fingers crossed, I don't want to fight a dragon again."
Dialog_Action_990700291_1,"Wow, that's quite a bunch of these little green monsters, I'm wondering how large their nest was."
Dialog_Action_990700291_2,"Therefore, it is more difficult to deal with these goblins than a dragon, it will be difficult to wipe them all out."
Dialog_Action_990700291_3,From my understanding it would be the same as dealing with irradiated Radroaches.
Dialog_Action_990700291_4,"Alright, I'll feel the scent of magic next. The humans and dragons are all yours."
Dialog_Action_990700291_5,"Odd, since goblins can't use the magic...why  has there been a scent of magic all over the place...many goblins have left traces of magic..."
Dialog_Action_990700291_6,"Saashi, how long do you think it takes for a dragon to grow up?"
Dialog_Action_990700291_7,"No idea, but it should take a long time."
Dialog_Action_990700291_8,Is it an illusion that the dragon in front of me is getting bigger?
Dialog_Action_990700291_9,!! Seems not!
Dialog_Action_990700292_1,Are you sure it understands you and won't betray us?
Dialog_Action_990700292_2,"No worries, human! The dragon is intelligent. It understands we are on the same side, as it wants to return to Tamriel."
Dialog_Action_990700292_3,That's great ...
Dialog_Action_990700292_4,The dragon's power should be getting stronger as it grows...
Dialog_Action_990700292_5,"But this land is barren of magic, we can't help it become more powerful."
Dialog_Action_990700292_6,Well...The magic scent in the goblin cave is worth exploring. Many goblins were strengthened by the magic.
Dialog_Action_990700292_7,"If we can find the magic to make this dragon stronger, it will surely be our most powerful ally."
Dialog_Action_990700292_8,What's in these goblins? What's this? Metal seals? There is magic flowing through it!
Dialog_Action_990700292_9,Do you feel something?
Dialog_Action_990700292_10,"There is a strong magical breath which is different from all the previous ones. We have to check out this fork in the road, perhaps the magical tablets we found that can strengthen the goblins should be used together with the seal! !!"
Dialog_Action_990700292_11,"I didn't expect you to have such a good sense of smell, like a cat."
Dialog_Action_990700292_12,Khajiit is not a cat.
Dialog_Action_990700293_1,It's right here! The scent of magic! These goblins must be carrying something in the same shape as the tablet!
Dialog_Action_990700293_2,We must use them together to make it work. Go find that hidden goblin!
Dialog_Action_990700293_3,Done. We have found everything we need. We'll give it a try though we don't know what magic it is.
Dialog_Action_990700293_4,Use the seal to transfer the magic from the tablet to our dragon. It'll become more powerful.
Dialog_Action_990700294_1,How is your experiment? Has the dragon become powerful?
Dialog_Action_990700294_2,Give it some time.. The magic has taken into effect.
Dialog_Action_990700294_3,"Well, unfortunately, we don't have much time. The goblins were furious at us for stealing the seal and now they have surrounded us."
Dialog_Action_990700294_4,You have any ideas?
Dialog_Action_990700294_5,"Simple, get the rope and run. Leave the dragon alone, it will fly away!"
Dialog_Action_990700295_1,Looks like our dragon has adapted to the magic.
Dialog_Action_990700295_2,"Yes, it's helpful, although we don't know where the magic originates from yet."
Dialog_Action_990700295_3,"Okay then, let's go back to the goblins to look into it. There is another task, find the origin of the goblin's magic."
Dialog_Action_990700296_1,"Now that we're right in here with the goblins, there might be some clues."
Dialog_Action_990700296_2,"But for now, there is no difference between here and the outside."
Dialog_Action_990700296_3,We cant expect to figure out everything very quickly either.
Dialog_Action_990700296_4,Whoa! What was that behemoth just now!
Dialog_Action_990700296_5,Should be a troll! Why is it here?
Dialog_Action_990700296_6,That's not normal! Goblins and trolls are not the same type monsters!
Dialog_Action_990700296_7,"That means, someone sent them to this world on purpose. We can definitely find the teleportation array that they were transported to if we go further!"
Dialog_Action_990700296_8,Hoo-hoo! !
Dialog_Action_990700297_1,"The farther we go, the more difficult the monsters are to deal with. Luckily, our dragon friend is getting stronger."
Dialog_Action_990700297_2,"""Ow-wooo""!"
Dialog_Action_990700297_3,It's flattered.
Dialog_Action_990700297_4,It doesn't seem like that the dragon is that difficult to get along with. I'm starting to think it's similar to being with a dog.
Dialog_Action_990700297_5,"Not really, this dragon is different from the normal ones which are not intelligent."
Dialog_Action_990700297_6,Hoo-hoo! !
Dialog_Action_990700297_7,The scent of magic again. There must be more tablets here that can strengthen the dragon!
Dialog_Action_990700298_1,Why is there no path ahead? Is it underground water?
Dialog_Action_990700298_2,Do goblins breathe? Any chance they came from underwater?
Dialog_Action_990700298_3,Or they did it on purpose to draw water over to protect their cave.
Dialog_Action_990700298_4,Not sure if they have such wisdom ...
Dialog_Action_990700298_5,"Well, the dragon should also be able to swim. Let's dive down to look into it."
Dialog_Action_990700298_6,Oh! Another seal that fits with the tablet.
Dialog_Action_990700298_7,Then we can reinforce the dragon twice in a row!
Dialog_Action_990700299_1,Whoa! Didn't expect there would be a hidden world underwater.
Dialog_Action_990700299_2,This obviously is not what Mount Mabel was originally. The teleportation array did not transport this place away.
Dialog_Action_990700299_3,"Find the teleportation array, then we will be able to send both this place and us back."
Dialog_Action_990700299_4,"Oh, I'm a little sad to part with you guys."
Dialog_Action_990700299_5,That scent of magic again. We can strengthen the dragon again here!
Dialog_Action_990700299_6,"Same old way, let's search around."
Dialog_Action_990700300_1,"Whether above or below ground, many of the Goblins have the signs of magic on them. They used to be small creatures and are now bigger because of the magic."
Dialog_Action_990700300_2,"This magic is not natural. We haven't found any magical goblins in our path, so it must be a mage that brought them here."
Dialog_Action_990700300_3,Could it be that they didn't teleport away in the first place?
Dialog_Action_990700300_4,"Even if they had been hiding here, they would not have just suddenly mastered magic. Either they were teleported here or someone else has teleported here."
Dialog_Action_990700300_5,"Anyway, there must be a teleportation array, maybe our dragon was teleported by him, too!"
Dialog_Action_990700301_1,"It seems that the further we advance, the more powerful the goblins are."
Dialog_Action_990700301_2,"Look, there's blood on the ground."
Dialog_Action_990700301_3,Whose blood is it? Goblin blood?
Dialog_Action_990700301_4,"No, this is...dragon blood?"
Dialog_Action_990700301_5,Hoo-hoo! ! !
Dialog_Action_990700301_6,You mean you escaped from here? I see. Let's move to the deepest location. Where you were held at the beginning.
Dialog_Action_990700301_7,The enemies ahead must be more dangerous. We'd better find all the tablets to be safe.
Dialog_Action_990700302_1,Squeak squeak! ! Dragon! Squeak squeak! !
Dialog_Action_990700302_2,Did they just talk! !
Dialog_Action_990700302_3,Huh? !
Dialog_Action_990700302_4,"No way, absolutely impossible! Goblins can't talk!"
Dialog_Action_990700302_5,Dragon! Escape! Catch!
Dialog_Action_990700302_6,The goblins are saying that...they used to hold the dragon captive?
Dialog_Action_990700302_7,Can't be! Creatures like goblins can't even deal with the smallest of dragons!
Dialog_Action_990700302_8,There must be something more powerful behind it! The mage who did all these things is definitely a demon!
Dialog_Action_990700302_9,"Regardless of what's behind it, it's certainly a problem for the world! Let's stop him!"
Dialog_Action_990700303_1,"This place is indeed different, the other caves were dug out, but this one is flat inside, it can't be the goblins that made it."
Dialog_Action_990700303_2,"There must be plenty of powerful goblins here, so be careful!"
Dialog_Action_990700303_3,Hoo-hoo!
Dialog_Action_990700303_4,"Well, be careful even though you're strong now."
Dialog_Action_990700304_1,Shhh! There are a lot of goblins ahead! Plus it is very dark inside!
Dialog_Action_990700304_2,Well...There's a chance we can defeat them...
Dialog_Action_990700304_3,"It's dangerous. We're not like the goblins, use your brain!"
Dialog_Action_990700304_4,"""Ow-wooo""!"
Dialog_Action_990700304_5,"Shhh! Fine, let's move very cautiously, keep away from them as much as you can!"
Dialog_Action_990700304_6,"Phew! Finally, it's safe. The goblins and trolls here are much crazier."
Dialog_Action_990700304_7,"Look! There were signs of a campfire here, neither goblins nor trolls need campfires, so it must have been a mage who came this way!"
Dialog_Action_990700304_8,"So the facts is, there's a mage here experimenting with goblins, its ultimate target might be our dragon!"
Dialog_Action_990700304_9,The dragon itself is powerful. It'll be more powerful if enhanced with various magic.
Dialog_Action_990700304_10,"But he didn't expect the dragon to escape, so he might have teleported back in search of new prey!"
Dialog_Action_990700304_11,Then there must be a teleportation array! We are all going home!
Dialog_Action_990700305_1,Finish them off! Find the teleportation array!
Dialog_Action_990700305_2,Hoo-hoo! ! !
Dialog_Action_990700305_3,These guys looked even more excited when they heard they were going home...
Dialog_Action_990700305_4,Nevertheless ...if I can also go home to see my family...
Dialog_Action_990700305_5,"I'll be more excited than they are, I guess."
Dialog_Action_990700306_1,There are a lot of tablets scattered around. The mage who studied this must have done a lot of experiments.
Dialog_Action_990700306_2,Maybe we can also find something helpful.
Dialog_Action_990700306_3,"This mage made something really helpful. Saashi, how come you did not invent any magic?"
Dialog_Action_990700306_4,It is blasphemy to invent magic indiscriminately! How could the Khajiit have done this! He should be a scholar that protects the ancient wisdom.
Dialog_Action_990700306_5,Is it hard to admit that you are not as good as others?
Dialog_Action_990700306_6,"...That makes me sick, human!"
Dialog_Action_990700306_7,"""Ow-wooo""!"
Dialog_Action_990700306_8,"That's it, the seal! Stand still! After them!"
Dialog_Action_990700307_1,"The scent of magic is getting stronger, we are getting closer to the target."
Dialog_Action_990700307_2,Defeat these enemies. Maybe we'll find a few more tablets.
Dialog_Action_990700307_3,Why is this guy carving magic into the tablet!
Dialog_Action_990700307_4,Anything wrong with the tablet?
Dialog_Action_990700307_5,It's too heavy!
Dialog_Action_990700308_1,"Watch out, there's a trap."
Dialog_Action_990700308_2,What trap?
Dialog_Action_990700308_3,There is magic scattered all around that can affect the mind. You humans will be affected since you don't know magic.
Dialog_Action_990700308_4,"How, how can I deal with it?"
Dialog_Action_990700308_5,There is no choice but to get out of here as soon as possible. It seems we are getting closer to destination.
Dialog_Action_990700308_6,"""Ow-wooo""!"
Dialog_Action_990700308_7,"Whew, it's safe now, I had a feeling like I was seeing a lot of strange things."
Dialog_Action_990700308_8,We have come so far yet haven’t found any trace of him.
Dialog_Action_990700308_9,Does the mage you mentioned really exist?
Dialog_Action_990700308_10,"He may not be here, but everything here is a clue that he left behind!"
Dialog_Action_990700308_11,"Even if he's not here, the teleportation array must be!"
Dialog_Action_990700309_1,The innermost are should where his lair is located. Check out all the monsters out there.
Dialog_Action_990700309_2,"Don't startle them, if the mage is there, our fight will alert him to us."
Dialog_Action_990700309_3,I still have plenty of ropes. Let's sneak in!
Dialog_Action_990700309_4,Hoo...
Dialog_Action_990700309_5,Shhh! !
Dialog_Action_990700309_6,There should be another tablet nearby.
Dialog_Action_990700309_7,Shall we take it? !
Dialog_Action_990700309_8,Better to check it out. Just in case.
Dialog_Action_990700310_1,Stop it! You evil Mage! Khajiit has found all the tablets you have made!
Dialog_Action_990700310_2,Hoo-hoo!
Dialog_Action_990700310_3,"It's, it's not quite the same as what you described!"
Dialog_Action_990700310_4,This...is the Frost Giant! It's a summoned golem!
Dialog_Action_990700310_5,So?
Dialog_Action_990700310_6,"So he must have been here, but got away. This is the bodyguard he summoned!"
Dialog_Action_990700310_7,Hoo-hoo! ! !
Dialog_Action_990700310_8,Dragon...Discover! Catch! Catch!
Dialog_Action_990700310_9,Whoop...whoop...
Dialog_Action_990700310_10,"He is definitely a powerful mage, the frost giant was pretty strong."
Dialog_Action_990700310_11,That was quite a challenge. Is that pile of rocks the array you were looking for?
Dialog_Action_990700310_12,That's it......Bah! ! It's damaged! There's no magic at all! !
Dialog_Action_990700310_13,Ah...Then it appears that there must be another dragon in the Vault.
Dialog_Action_990700310_14,Owow?
Dialog_Action_990700310_15,"Ok, just one more question ..."
Dialog_Action_990700310_16,What is it?
Dialog_Action_990700310_17,"Was the magic array destroyed after the mage teleported away, or was it destroyed when the dragon fled?"
Dialog_Action_990700310_18,Does it matter?
Dialog_Action_990700310_19,Of course! It's fine if he has left...But what if he hasn't?
Dialog_Action_990700310_20,He will destroy the world when he can!
Dialog_Action_990700311_1,Goblins guarding here? Do they even understand the concept of guarding something?
Dialog_Action_990700311_2,Why is it so important?
Dialog_Action_990700312_1,It has some powerful magic! I can even feel it from here!
Dialog_Action_990700312_2,"It is supposed to be the ancient dragon clan magic, which might help enhance our power!"
Dialog_Action_990700312_3,It is...such a powerful goblin...This is definitely not an ability a goblin should have.
Dialog_Action_990700312_4,"What's the heck wrong with this goblin...Wait, there's a tablet here?"
Dialog_Action_990700312_5,There is a strange symbol and some magic remnants on it. Goblins are not supposed to know magic.
Dialog_Action_990700312_6,What the heck is going on here?
Dialog_Action_990700313_1,"We've got a lot of goblins here, too. They look even bigger than the ones outside..."
Dialog_Action_990700313_2,The magic scent here is familiar to me. It reminds of the magic remaining on the tablet that was found earlier.
Dialog_Action_990700313_3,"Stay alert, everyone! There may be some powerful goblins here!"
Dialog_Action_990700314_1,Whoa! Surprised that there is yet another place here. Will the powerful goblin you mentioned before be here?
Dialog_Action_990700314_2,Maybe. My notes can feel the magic getting closer.
Dialog_Action_990700314_3,What kind of goblins lives in this large place? And it's obviously not a cave dug by the goblins!
Dialog_Action_990700314_4,"Agreed. This is not a place the goblins can create, maybe they captured it?"
Dialog_Action_990700314_5,I'm not sure about the creatures in your world. Let's destroy them anyway.
Dialog_Action_990700314_6,Watch out! Those goblins that are enhanced by magic are very difficult to deal with!
Dialog_Action_990700314_7,No powerful goblins at all.
Dialog_Action_990700314_8,They've been enhanced already. Normal goblins won't have these abilities.
Dialog_Action_990700314_9,Do you mean the strange pattern on this tablet is the magic that enhances the goblins?
Dialog_Action_990700314_10,"It should be.There has never been such magic in Khajiit's records. Since it enhanced goblins, it can enhance the dragons as well.  We're still missing something that can match the pattern. Perhaps we can find it on the goblins."
Dialog_Action_990700314_11,Hoo?
Dialog_Action_990700315_1,Oh! Damn! I lost my notes when escaping!
Dialog_Action_990700315_2,Is it important? !
Dialog_Action_990700315_3,Absolutely! I've recorded many magic and clues about them in that notebook.
Dialog_Action_990700315_4,"Well, let's go back to retrieve it if that's the case. We may also find some helpful magic for the dragon."
Dialog_Action_990700316_1,"Ok. As we know how to deal with them,"
Dialog_Action_990700316_2,"let's get into the goblin cave, finish off the goblin defenders and take the stone tablets that will enhance our dragon."
Dialog_Action_990700316_3,I'll follow the notes and find the signs of magic. Let's go!
Dialog_Action_990700317_1,"These magic tablets are really strange. The  magic of the Nords is all in the words, it seems it is all a pattern."
Dialog_Action_990700317_2,"Moreover, this is only a record of the magic, the seal needs to be engraved on the body to take effect. A lot of the goblins have been enhanced. Why would he do that?"
Dialog_Action_990700317_3,This is no ancient magic for sure. It was created.
Dialog_Action_990700317_4,Could it be that this mage teleported the goblins here?
Dialog_Action_990700318_1,"Exactly! Right here, this is a hidden cave."
Dialog_Action_990700318_2,"Regardless of who left the tablets, it seemed he was experimenting with the goblins to test whether the tablets worked."
Dialog_Action_990700318_3,Looks like he made it.
Dialog_Action_990700319_1,"Yes, there must have a magic tablet ahead."
Dialog_Action_990700319_2,There is a river over there! Don't you hear the sound of running water?
Dialog_Action_990700319_3,Save your breath. Just get in the water!
Dialog_Action_990700320_1,Another tablet placed in water.
Dialog_Action_990700320_2,Didn't he think about how to get it out?
Dialog_Action_990700320_3,He could have ordered the goblins.
Dialog_Action_990700320_4,That's why you told me to do that?
Dialog_Action_990700321_1,The cave is intricate. Maybe the tablet is in the water as well.
Dialog_Action_990700321_2,You go this time!
Dialog_Action_990700321_3,...Petty human!
Dialog_Action_990700322_1,"For the win! Rookies, congrats on being able to participate in the most glorious mission of the Brotherhood! Now follow me to get the materials below!"
Dialog_Action_990700322_2,Don't look at me like that! Not even Elder Maxson would survive here without collecting supplies!
Dialog_Action_990700322_3,This is why our mission is important and honorable. Let me brief the mission. It is to clear out the nearby radiation creatures for the people. Practice your shooting skills in this mission. Don't use any weapon but your rifle to finish them off!
Dialog_Action_990700322_4,"For the win, people! Don't forget how many are waiting for us in the rear!"
Dialog_Action_990700322_5,"Yes, sir!"
Dialog_Action_990700322_6,Oh! Brotherhood! You guys are doing a great job! We won't get attacked when out there planting mutant fruit for sure!
Dialog_Action_990700322_7,But the supplies we have to provide this month...are... too much...
Dialog_Action_990700322_8,"Are you not happy with it? Didn't the Brotherhood provide you with security, which is the most valuable thing in the wasteland? Are you keeping these materials for your family's funeral?"
Dialog_Action_990700322_9,"Yea yea yea, you're right..."
Dialog_Action_990700322_10,"Oh right, remember to give us some of the mutant fruits when they're ripe! See you later, civilians!"
Dialog_Action_990700323_1,"Aye, Scribe Haylen, are you sure that the Minutemen stole food from us?"
Dialog_Action_990700323_2,Couldn't be a robbery. It was that the people of this farm supported the Minutemen by giving them food. Some of us were detained when asking for it.
Dialog_Action_990700323_3,The Minutemen are in no position to protect them! They couldn't even protect themselves. They tricked these honest people with fancy words and cheated them out of their food! We have to make the Minutemen hand over the food!
Dialog_Action_990700323_4,"Alas, I don't want to get into a conflict with them."
Dialog_Action_990700323_5,Minutemen! You have deceived the people and cheated them out of their food. I now demand you hand over the farm to Brotherhood!
Dialog_Action_990700323_6,Bah! You outsiders have no right to do that!
Dialog_Action_990700323_7,The Brotherhood came here to uphold order and the security of people on the wasteland! You are but a pack of peasants who have taken up arms! Turn yourselves in! Hand over the food that should be given to us!
Dialog_Action_990700323_8,"Bah! That Wicked Tin Man, impossible!"
Dialog_Action_990700323_9,Didn't expect it ended up like this...
Dialog_Action_990700323_10,"It serves them right, Scribe! Only the Brotherhood can bring order and security. People of the wasteland will understand that sooner or later."
Dialog_Action_990700324_1,"For the win, rookies! Our mission this time is to retrieve a piece of pre-war technology!"
Dialog_Action_990700324_2,Sir! There is nothing but a river in front of us!
Dialog_Action_990700324_3,That's right. It's in the river. All you have to do is jump in and find it!
Dialog_Action_990700324_4,Sir! It could damage the power armor!
Dialog_Action_990700324_5,"Hmm, what do you think Inspector Ingram's here for? Enough nonsense. All of you, go down into the river!"
Dialog_Action_990700324_6,"Guggling... (Good, we have found it.)"
Dialog_Action_990700324_7,"Guggling? (Wait, there's gunfire above our heads?)"
Dialog_Action_990700324_8,"Guggling! (You guys take back the stuff, I'm going to check it out.)"
Dialog_Action_990700325_1,Kells! What happened?
Dialog_Action_990700325_2,"Dans and I came here on a mission, thinking there wouldn't be too many enemies, but it turns out there was a Synth ambush! Our aircraft was shot down. Dans and some other guys fell inside surrounded."
Dialog_Action_990700325_3,"Damn, the Synth will tear them apart! Maybe it's the stuff I took away that led the Institute here...No worries. We will get Dans out!"
Dialog_Action_990700325_4,Hold on! These are...some technologies that have never been before!
Dialog_Action_990700325_5,The Synth may be coming for them! Then I'm going to send them back to the airship! They're definitely valuable!
Dialog_Action_990700325_6,"I am glad that you're all right, brothers!"
Dialog_Action_990700325_7,Stay alive! Or you'll be wasting the effort I put into maintaining your weapons.
Dialog_Action_990700326_1,"Elder Maxson, I'm sorry to make you come in person. Nilia tried to convince them earlier but was detained."
Dialog_Action_990700326_2,"This incident is related to the nuclear bomb after all. The Atomists are a pack of crazy people, so I have took command personally."
Dialog_Action_990700326_3,"No more talking, Teagan, let's make this quick and get back the nukes before they activate it!"
Dialog_Action_990700326_4,"These lunatics are obsessed with radiation. They have even spread hallucinogenic substances in the air...I have to solve this problem fast or I will go crazy, too."
Dialog_Action_990700326_5,Phew! It's finally done.
Dialog_Action_990700326_6,"Ouch, my waist...I'm afraid I can't fight any more."
Dialog_Action_990700326_7,Do you want me to check it for you?
Dialog_Action_990700326_8,Let's wait until we get back to the ship. I wish I had someone I could trust to help. If so I’d invite them into the Brotherhood.
Dialog_Action_990700327_1,"Let me check this raider...Well, the main structure is intact, but there seems to be some problems with the limbs."
Dialog_Action_990700327_2,We need to replace the arm. Then I'll activate it so it can help us escape.
Dialog_Action_990700327_3,"Okay, it's standing up now."
Dialog_Action_990700327_4,Raider's ready. New command required.
Dialog_Action_990700327_5,Fantastic! We fixed it. Go blast the animals out of the way and show me what you can do!
Dialog_Action_990700327_6,Command received.
Dialog_Action_990700328_1,Look what I found this time. Thanks to the designers this Raiders modules are really awesome. Let me just load the new weapon for it.
Dialog_Action_990700328_2,"Good, now you're a fully armed raider. Let's see what you've got!  There are mutants up ahead. Finish them off!"
Dialog_Action_990700328_3,Command received. Clearing the enemy.
Dialog_Action_990700328_4,Warning. Support component malfunction!  Support component malfunction!
Dialog_Action_990700328_5,Damn! The weapon I loaded was too heavy for the malfunctioning legs of this Raider.
Dialog_Action_990700328_6,Let me find a compatible support component.
Dialog_Action_990700329_1,I really am stupid to transform a raider. I might have reached the Far Harbor if I had just escaped!
Dialog_Action_990700329_2,The good thing is that there is a raider robot in this Vault...Take it out and you can get the support components.
Dialog_Action_990700329_3,Hope its legs hold out until then...
Dialog_Action_990700329_4,Fantastic! We have taken it down! Let me replace this component...
Dialog_Action_990700329_5,It worked! Now its’ not overloading!
Dialog_Action_990700329_6,We can now easily make it to Far Harbor!
Dialog_Action_990700329_7,Report! A trace of an escaped Synth has been found.  He dismantled the legs of a raider...Warning. She has a raider with her.
Dialog_Action_990700329_8,We need to send lots of Synth immediately!
Dialog_Action_990700330_1,Damn! Can't believe the hunter found it!
Dialog_Action_990700330_2,I have to make the raider protect me until I can find a way out.
Dialog_Action_990700330_3,ASSAULTRON! Take care of all the Synth and the hunters!
Dialog_Action_990700330_4,Command received.
Dialog_Action_990700330_5,The raider's power is dropping fast. You are out of options!
Dialog_Action_990700330_6,Initiate a general attack!
Dialog_Action_990700331_1,Damn damn damn! I'm surrounded! And going to be taken back!
Dialog_Action_990700331_2,No.....No! Never! I will never be taken back! I don't want to be!
Dialog_Action_990700331_3,I would rather... die against the hunters! Wait...Raider! Come to me!
Dialog_Action_990700331_4,"As expected! This Raider's computing power is also quite good, almost the same as that of the Institute’s technology. So in that case..."
Dialog_Action_990700331_5,Nothing will happen to me then!
Dialog_Action_990700331_6,Synth parts and ASSAULTRON found...
Dialog_Action_990700331_7,"Strange, no external injuries to the Synth parts."
Dialog_Action_990700331_8,"Bahaha......hunters, surprised?"
Dialog_Action_990700331_9,Oh! Damn! You transferred your awareness to the raiders! Get ready to fight!!
Dialog_Action_990700331_10,It feels really...different.
Dialog_Action_990700331_11,I can now live a free life in the Wasteland... living on my own.
Dialog_Action_990700331_12,"Let's check out the nearest place......Hmmm, Goodneighbor?"
Dialog_Action_990700346_1,"We are finally in the wasteland. Remember our mission, scout the area as fast as possible and prepare for the ushering in Elder Maxson!"
Dialog_Action_990700346_2,"Hey, it looks like there is no danger in this area, just some small dogs and crabs here. No threat at all."
Dialog_Action_990700346_3,Be careful. Let's go!
Dialog_Action_990700346_4,"From what we can tell, the remains of tech are all scattered,  we'll have to split up."
Dialog_Action_990700346_5,Orders received. Splitting up will make our reconnaissance more efficient.
Dialog_Action_990700347_1,"Tara, are you sure the distress message was from here?"
Dialog_Action_990700347_2,"Yes, Captain. It was from Faris and was sent in haste. It seemed like he was in a very bad situation."
Dialog_Action_990700347_3,Proceed with caution. Looks like it's going to be very dangerous here. Focus on rescuing and not fighting.
Dialog_Action_990700347_4,"Captain, over here!"
Dialog_Action_990700347_5,Malden! Are you alright? Where are Faris and Farhan?
Dialog_Action_990700347_6,We were dispersed. The super mutants here are different. They are much more intelligent than the ones we met before!
Dialog_Action_990700347_7,"Hurry up! Can you keep moving? If you can, stay with us!"
Dialog_Action_990700347_8,"Captain, your finally here!"
Dialog_Action_990700347_9,"Are you alright, Farhan! Where's Faris?"
Dialog_Action_990700347_10,Faris... is dead. We were ambushed by super mutants. He was bleeding profusely...and died. I was not able to bring him out.
Dialog_Action_990700347_11,...Let's get out of here first.
Dialog_Action_990700348_1,Why hasn't Malden returned yet? Has he sent the distress signal to the Prydwin?
Dialog_Action_990700348_2,Could it be that something has happened to him? What about Farhan and I go out and search for him?
Dialog_Action_990700348_3,Do not act without permission. Something is wrong. I do not hear the wild dogs barking. Damn!  We may be surrounded!
Dialog_Action_990700348_4,Cheer up! We can't die here.
Dialog_Action_990700349_1,I wonder what happened to Tara and Farhan. They should be here based on the traces left behind. We must rescue them!
Dialog_Action_990700349_2,"Captain, I knew you would come! I got separated from Farhan, but he shouldn't be far away. Let's go support him!"
Dialog_Action_990700349_3,"Captain, you finally came. I followed the message left by Malden and get here, but only found his nameplate. I'm afraid he’s dead."
Dialog_Action_990700349_4,"Damn it! Anyway, we have to get out of here first! Send the message out and get help! The wasteland is extremely dangerous!"
Dialog_Action_990700350_1,"Captain, Farhan also died. What can we do? All the communication devices were with him, we have no way to contact the outside world now."
Dialog_Action_990700350_2,Don't worry about it! Go north. There should be a signal tower there. There is still hope if we can get to it.
Dialog_Action_990700350_3,"Okay, let's get out of here and head for the tower!"
Dialog_Action_990700350_4,"Captain, you go first. If we don’t stop the monsters here, we won't get far."
Dialog_Action_990700350_5,"You! OK, I'll find backup and come back for you as soon as I can! Make sure to hang in there!"
Dialog_Action_990700350_6,"(Muttering to himself) There should be a bunker to the north, which has the signal transmitter and is a great place to defend. Hold on, Tara!"
Dialog_Action_990700351_1,"(This is the memory of a railroad officer. In order to find out whose memory it is, we have to find out where all the railroad agents are first."
Dialog_Action_990700351_2,You must be the Synth that just escaped from the Institute. You seem to have some skill. It's not safe here. Follow me to get out.
Dialog_Action_990700351_3,(Looks like it's not me he saw in the memory but the railroad officer.)
Dialog_Action_990700351_4,"Hello Synth, or should I call you G7-81? I know you don't like that name, so I'm here to confirm. Do you agree to wiping the memory and start your life over?"
Dialog_Action_990700351_5,I want to keep the memory and join the railroad to fight for more Synth like me.
Dialog_Action_990700351_6,"(This is not what I said, the sound seems to be coming out this time, it looks like the memory was triggered directly)"
Dialog_Action_990700351_7,This road is bound to be hard and dangerous. Are you sure you are ready for it?
Dialog_Action_990700351_8,I'm ready. Let's go!
Dialog_Action_990700351_9,"Now that you've joined us, your Synth name should not be used anymore, your new name will be Gloria from now on, you'll be a Heavy Armor Agent, a symbol of glory in the cause of saving Synths!"
Dialog_Action_990700352_1,We should be able to escape from the hunters with this costume!
Dialog_Action_990700352_2,It's okay. We've gotten out and we're never going back to being tools again!
Dialog_Action_990700352_3,"Exactly, we are free now!"
Dialog_Action_990700352_4,"Don't...don't relax, I can feel...the danger approaching."
Dialog_Action_990700352_5,(The person of this memory is a rather timid patient. We must continue to explore his memory and find the problem)
Dialog_Action_990700352_7,How did they catch up with us?
Dialog_Action_990700352_8,This is the way to get out. What to do!
Dialog_Action_990700352_9,"(If you want to overcome this problem, you have to fight and win here. Don't escape!)"
Dialog_Action_990700352_10,Let's go! We can defeat them! For freedom!
Dialog_Action_990700353_1,(This is Gabriel's memory. How can this place be so quiet? Look around to see if there is someone else.)
Dialog_Action_990700353_2,Woof...woof...woof...woof
Dialog_Action_990700353_3,Are you going to go with me? Good!
Dialog_Action_990700353_4,What took you so long! You're the one who asked for my help against the hunters. Why are you hiding yourself again!
Dialog_Action_990700353_5,Just the three of us? Hunters won't be easy to deal with.
Dialog_Action_990700353_6,"Don't worry. We have a ""friend"" coming."
Dialog_Action_990700353_7,"Finally, I thought you were taken out halfway, so now it's our turn to take them out!"
Dialog_Action_990700354_1,"(The memory this time was provided to me by Mr. Nick, if I remember correctly, but why does it feel just like before?)"
Dialog_Action_990700354_2,Get me that detective! Don't let him get away!
Dialog_Action_990700354_3,"Whew, the memory adventure this time is exciting!"
Dialog_Action_990700355_1,"(This is the memory of Danse after his internal breakdown, I need to help him rebuild his faith)"
Dialog_Action_990700355_2,"Captain, I believe in you so I'm following you."
Dialog_Action_990700355_3,"Hey brother, you are the one who showed me courage and persistence. You are just like before. Don't be discouraged. I will stand with you."
Dialog_Action_990700355_4,"Paladin Danse, you have done your job well. I will join you on your next mission."
Dialog_Action_990700355_5,"Yoo-hoo! You're Danse, aren't you? Thank you for the technology you brought back last time, it was very helpful. Thanks to you, we were able to accomplish a lot in such a short amount of time."
Dialog_Action_990700356_1,"Poor people, entranced by love and ignoring the preciousness of life. Alas, the Lord will blame me if I don't do something about it."
Dialog_Action_990700356_2,"Father, Father, thanks for coming. Did the Lord send you?"
Dialog_Action_990700356_3,"Come with me, let’s get out of here. It's not safe for any more love games."
Dialog_Action_990700356_4,"No! No, I believe my love will be tested. Father, help me! O Lord! Help me!"
Dialog_Action_990700356_5,"Silly! Alas, never mind. Go but don't get too far away from me."
Dialog_Action_990700357_1,This should be the place according to that nice man.
Dialog_Action_990700357_2,"Stand still, your suspicious! Are you here to grab the treasure, too?"
Dialog_Action_990700357_3,"Treasure? That nice man is true to his word. I really got the bottle cap here. Thank you, Lord!"
Dialog_Action_990700358_1,"Strange, this place used to be very noisy in the past, why is it like this today?"
Dialog_Action_990700358_2,Where are the drinkers?
Dialog_Action_990700358_3,Where are the braggarts?
Dialog_Action_990700358_4,Where are the brawls?
Dialog_Action_990700358_5,How can this place be empty?
Dialog_Action_990700358_6,"Why are you hiding here, where are the others?"
Dialog_Action_990700358_7,"They...they found a hidden door in here and went in, thinking there was treasure inside. It's been days and none of them have returned."
Dialog_Action_990700358_8,Are you worried about them? Then lead the way. Let's get them back.
Dialog_Action_990700358_9,"Well, the door was by the elevator, and the key to the door was hidden by me."
Dialog_Action_990700358_10,Father! Father! Help me! Take me with you!
Dialog_Action_990700358_11,"Lord, what has this child been through these days? Come with me. The Lord will save you."
Dialog_Action_990700358_12,"Someone help me, I'm so hungry and sleepy, I’m dying."
Dialog_Action_990700358_13,"Hang in there, boys! You haven't achieved what you set out to. Don't give up."
Dialog_Action_990700358_14,What kind of demon is doing this to these kids? I will extinguish it on behalf of the Lord.
Dialog_Action_990700359_1,Why am I so agitated today? Where is Diego? Why didn't he come today? I will go to town to look for him.
Dialog_Action_990700359_2,Diego is not here. The nearby dwellers may have seen him.
Dialog_Action_990700359_3,Did you ever meet Diego?
Dialog_Action_990700359_4,"I saw him yesterday, he kept muttering about a cute girl."
Dialog_Action_990700359_5,Cute girl?
Dialog_Action_990700359_6,Did you ever meet Diego?
Dialog_Action_990700359_7,"Yea, yea. He was muttering with his head down, ""panicked at the sight of you"", then headed out of town."
Dialog_Action_990700359_8,Panicked at the sight!?!?
Dialog_Action_990700359_9,"Um, I have to get him back."
Dialog_Action_990700359_10,"Letter: Father, I'm sorry. I fell in love with the girl who wanted a mystery stone and I needed the bottle cap for that stone. I'm sorry I took the money from the collection box. I'm really sorry."
Dialog_Action_990700359_11,"Silly kid, she does not really love you. Doesn't matter. I will find you. The Lord will help me enlighten you."
Dialog_Action_990700360_1,Diego should have made it here. I have to ask the dwellers who came in earlier to help me find him.
Dialog_Action_990700360_2,"Hey, Father, I don't see the kid here. I think he headed down."
Dialog_Action_990700360_3,Thanks. Let's go after him!
Dialog_Action_990700360_4,Father! He knocked me out and ran away! I'm going to teach him a lesson!
Dialog_Action_990700360_5,"Take it easy, the Lord will punish him for you. Come with me and bring him back! It is too dangerous here."
Dialog_Action_990700360_6,This should be the last room. He must be here.
Dialog_Action_990700360_7,"Father...Sorry, she took the bottle cap away. I...was tricked."
Dialog_Action_990700360_8,"Alas, silly boy! Come back with me."
Dialog_Action_990700361_1,"The settings and conditions are not bad, but it  seems to have been abandoned for a long time. I don't know if the items inside still work."
Dialog_Action_990700361_2,"However, listening to the rustling sounds, there is probably a quite a lot of nasty mutant creatures making this their home."
Dialog_Action_990700361_3,Then let's clean them up first. We can't let these mutant creatures affect our plans.
Dialog_Action_990700362_1,"Finally, we’ve arrived in the underground ruins. We have to find the Brotherhood warriors that came in earlier. We won’t be able to cope with the dangers here if we don’t have their help."
Dialog_Action_990700362_2,"James, there you are! It’s lucky you're not walking around. It's dangerous here. Stay with me."
Dialog_Action_990700362_3,"Thank you for your help and especially thanks to Elder Lyons, our plans would not have worked without his support."
Dialog_Action_990700362_4,"You're welcome. Your plans are for the future of the wasteland, that's what we're willing to fight for."
Dialog_Action_990700362_5,"Here you are. There should be a lot of rare water samples in here, but this place has long since been taken over by these creatures."
Dialog_Action_990700362_6,"I hope they didn't taint any samples. Otherwise, this trip would be a total waste."
Dialog_Action_990700362_7,There's nothing to worry about. Take them out as soon as possible and keep the samples safe.
Dialog_Action_990700363_1,"James, why are you still here? That pack of Raiders and angry wasteland creatures are rushing in, we need to run."
Dialog_Action_990700363_2,We can't leave behind the samples and the experimental data. We can't let them destroy this precious information.
Dialog_Action_990700363_3,Your life is at stake. Go! Think of your pregnant wife!
Dialog_Action_990700363_4,"(Looks down and thinks) Catherine and the baby, well...Let's...Let's go."
Dialog_Action_990700364_1,"I'm sorry, son. I can never forget my mission. Even after all these years, this obsession is like a stigma, making me anxious all the time."
Dialog_Action_990700364_2,Is the Enclave already here? I can't let them catch me. Let's get out of here first.
Dialog_Action_990700365_1,"This is the last step, go to the control room, plug in this water purification chip and you can achieve the long-cherished dream for many years to come."
Dialog_Action_990700365_2,"We will stay with you, James. Although the equipment of the Enclave is very powerful, the will of the Brotherhood will pave the way for you."
Dialog_Action_990700365_3,"It's time to bring an end to it all, bring the wasteland back to life, and let it all start over."
Dialog_Action_990700371_1,What happened? How come the Hunters that were guarding the Institute are not here anymore?
Dialog_Action_990700371_2,"In this case, opportunity is rare, freedom is at hand, and today is the day for me to escape!"
Dialog_Action_990700372_1,I've been hiding here. Why did these wasteland creatures have to chase me down here?
Dialog_Action_990700372_2,Do I have to tell them that Synth...can't fill their bellies without eating meat?
Dialog_Action_990700373_1,"B5-92, forget this number, forget the past, and just start over. Wouldn’t that be great?"
Dialog_Action_990700373_2,"I decline. Although I am a Synth, I still think of a complete mind and consciousness, to be a complete human being!"
Dialog_Action_990700373_3,"Then you're not a human being, but a pawn of the Institute! Since you can't rid yourself of them! Then you're a threat! A threat must be destroyed!"
Dialog_Action_990700373_4,"In that case, no need to talk anymore. I'm leaving!"
Dialog_Action_990700374_1,"Hey, mate, are you looking for a thrill here?"
Dialog_Action_990700374_2,This is the land of freedom. Is it true that freedom truly exists here?
Dialog_Action_990700374_3,"If this is your place, then it's a place of your freedom."
Dialog_Action_990700374_4,How can I make this place mine?
Dialog_Action_990700374_5,Grab your gun and steel your heart.
Dialog_Action_990700375_1,"(Voice from afar) B5-92, are you turning yourself in?"
Dialog_Action_990700375_2,"I want to fight for my freedom. Since you have been hunting me, will you set me free if I defeat you here?"
Dialog_Action_990700375_3,"I will complete my mission, and you...do your best. Don't regret your choice."
Dialog_Action_990700376_1,These underground lowlifes are so annoying! Hurry and clean up this trashes before the plan is carried out! Don't let these creatures get in the way!
Dialog_Action_990700377_1,Mel this jerk is really stupid! He sent himself to prison and his mother must save him! What a bummer!
Dialog_Action_990700377_2,"No matter who sees this cassette, I'm no longer in this jail. Those idiots in Diamond City actually thought they had me for real. Nothing but a big illusion! I'm leaving now. If you want to find me, go to Goodneighbor, if you can."
Dialog_Action_990700377_3,Mel! !! I was wondering how that jerk got caught! I'll deal with him when I get back!
Dialog_Action_990700378_1,"Bobbie, we are now officially starting the plan. We need to locate a proper starting point first, but it might be tricky."
Dialog_Action_990700378_2,"Okay, I get it, you just tell me where it is! You shut up! Annoying!"
Dialog_Action_990700378_3,"Probably...It's probably in the area you're in now, look for it and you should be able to find a proper location."
Dialog_Action_990700379_1,"Mel, are you sure this hole is ok?"
Dialog_Action_990700379_2,"No problem, no problem. Even if it's wrong, it's just a couple of little crabs, it will definitely not be a problem for you."
Dialog_Action_990700379_3,Mel! !! I really want to feed it with you!
Dialog_Action_990700380_1,"Bobbie, are you sure this is the right place? I have the feeling that we are still too far off."
Dialog_Action_990700380_2,"Hehe, yes, yes, this is the place. We will get rich soon!"
Dialog_Action_990700380_3,(Snickering ) Hancock would never think I'd make it all the way to their little treasure trove.
Dialog_Action_990700380_4,"(Voice from afar) Mayor, what about the mice coming out of the ground?"
Dialog_Action_990700380_5,(Voice from afar) Sweep them away like the trash!
Dialog_Action_990700380_6,"Bastard! Mel, show me the way. Bastard! Bastard! We were trapped right from the start!"
Dialog_Action_990700380_7,"Wow, there's the mouse! Come on, let's fight!"
Dialog_Action_990700380_8,Bastard! Go to hell!
Dialog_Action_990700380_9,Here you are. I've caught you again.
Dialog_Action_990700380_10,Why are you here? Get out of my way!
Dialog_Action_990700380_11,Let me see who's here. Isn't this the little mouse?
Dialog_Action_990700380_12,Shadowy ghost! Get out of my way! We really didn't mean to do it (Can't say it was intentional)!
Dialog_Action_990700380_13,"(Applause) Not bad, I can't believe I got here. Here's the deal, you guys repel me, I'll let you off the hook."
Dialog_Action_990700380_14,"Tsk, keep your word! Be careful, if you don't take it seriously, you might get killed!"
Dialog_Action_990700380_15,"Hi, come on, hope you're hardy enough to fight."
Dialog_Action_990700366_1,(Low growl)...Ah...Ah...Whoop...Hoo! !
Dialog_Action_990700367_1,"Geez, what is this! A mutant. ?"
Dialog_Action_990700367_2,"Idiot, that's not hair! That's a Flower! It must be a beauty-loving mutant!"
Dialog_Action_990700367_3,Ow-wooo!!!
Dialog_Action_990700367_4,"Alas! It’s becoming displeased! Ahahahaha, hit him!"
Dialog_Action_990700368_1,Experimental target escaped. Annihilation command begin execution.
Dialog_Action_990700368_2,Go...go...go...home
Dialog_Action_990700368_3,Get...out...of...here
Dialog_Action_990700368_4,It...is...useful...
Dialog_Action_990700369_1,No...not...here
Dialog_Action_990700369_2,How did this monster come back!?!? Beat it! Exterminate it!
Dialog_Action_990700369_3,No...I can't...Kill...people...again...
Dialog_Action_990700369_4,"Familiar...stuff..., find..."
Dialog_Action_990700369_5,He doesn't seem to be targeting us. It was like he was looking for something.
Dialog_Action_990700369_6,Here...are...some
Dialog_Action_990700370_1,What kind of mutant is this? It's the one that attacked the Vault.
Dialog_Action_990700370_2,Wanderer...I...am...not...
Dialog_Action_990700370_3,"Ahh! Monster, don't come over, don't come over!"
Dialog_Action_990700370_4,This mutant is tough. Let me try!
Dialog_Action_990700370_5,Hurry...run...
Dialog_Action_990700370_6,"Ooh, so powerful, I'm leaving!"
Dialog_Action_990700370_7,I...didn't...mean...it
Dialog_Action_990700370_8,"You look quite familiar, but you are definitely a threat. Maybe we can avoid a fight if you still have any sense left."
Dialog_Action_990700370_9,You...are...you...are...ahhh! ! Get...away...Hurry...
Dialog_Action_990700370_10,You are out of control. It looks like we have to restrain you first.
Dialog_Action_990700370_11,"Your obsession is so strong, then I won't stop you!"
Dialog_Action_990700370_12,"I...am...I...am...I...remembered..., but...here...is..it's...not..."
Dialog_Action_800621101_1,Khajiit didn't detect any traces of ancient magic. Are you sure this is the place?
Dialog_Action_800621101_2,It is. I have a divine connection with it. It must be here.
Dialog_Action_800621101_3,"All right, I hope what you say is true."
Dialog_Action_800621101_4,"We have the same interests, so there is no need to deceive you."
Dialog_Action_800621101_5,Hope so.
Dialog_Action_800621103_1,Why are there goblins? They have always been bullies. There is no way they would be here if your empire was here.
Dialog_Action_800621103_2,"Heh, it's just the same old trick."
Dialog_Action_800621103_3,"It's your same old trick, isn't it? Well if there are not anymore obvious signs here, then you are suspicious."
Dialog_Action_800621103_4,Isn't the most obvious sign is that wasteland creatures and goblins are in love with each other?
Dialog_Action_800621103_5,That's true...but Khajiit couldn't feel any magic fluctuations.
Dialog_Action_800621103_6,That is all it can do. Keep going.
Dialog_Action_800621301_1,"It is true that these goblins have hidden something, which could be some kind of enchanted item."
Dialog_Action_800621301_2,"This question has come up before, why do these goblins have a mastery of magic far beyond that of their kin?"
Dialog_Action_800621301_3,What are you waiting for? Let's go.
Dialog_Action_800621303_1,This is it. It should be the rune that has a very familiar scent.
Dialog_Action_800621303_2,I am also familiar with the scent of this rune. Is it yours?
Dialog_Action_800621303_3,It is ours. Seeing it now I think I understand how it hides the magic fluctuations.
Dialog_Action_800621303_4,Shielding magic with magic?
Dialog_Action_800621303_5,Smart kitten. This area should have two more such runes. Take away the rune. Then I will will be able to break the barrier.
Dialog_Action_800621105_1,"After we took the leftover runes, we really were able to perceive the magic fluctuations. Brilliant!"
Dialog_Action_800621105_2,It's just a little trick to break the barrier.
Dialog_Action_800621105_3,Looks like you know it well.
Dialog_Action_800621105_4,"Don’t try it, I’ve worked with it for decades, I understand the methods."
Dialog_Action_800621105_5,"Hmph, it really is two peas in a pod."
Dialog_Action_800621105_6,"It's good to remain suspicious, but it would be foolish to be so obvious about it."
Dialog_Action_800621105_7,"Go ahead, but I hope you're not setting us up again."
Dialog_Action_800621106_1,I was familiar with your tactics along the way. It feels like I've encountered them somewhere before.
Dialog_Action_800621106_2,"They are of ancient magic. You study magic, so it's normal that you're familiar with them."
Dialog_Action_800621106_3,"(Is it the same magic as the summoning of the frost giant earlier? Any chance that was it? Are you alright, Mobula?)"
Dialog_Action_800621106_4,"Maybe, let's keep exploring."
Dialog_Action_800621401_1,The second rune in this area should be right around here.
Dialog_Action_800621401_2,"Okay, let's start looking. (I have to find the runes faster than they do)."
Dialog_Action_800621404_1,Feeble creatures. Don't hide. I know the runes are on you.
Dialog_Action_800621404_2,(Where did you get the sense of superiority!?!? )That's right. Hand it over and Khajiit won't have to fight!
Dialog_Action_800621404_3,:Squeak squeak!  Squeak!
Dialog_Action_800621404_4,It doesn't look like they are ready to communicate properly.
Dialog_Action_800621404_5,Then let's solve it the old fashioned way.
Dialog_Action_800621107_1,There are only a few goblins and wasteland creatures being controlled by them. Where is the sign of your empire? Are you lying to me?
Dialog_Action_800621107_2,Why would I benefit from lying to you?
Dialog_Action_800621107_3,"You tell me. (Maybe there isn't another Lich, maybe it's all just part of your scheme)"
Dialog_Action_800621107_4,Fine. Just move on. Explore more to find more clues.
Dialog_Action_800621107_5,"That's right, maybe we'll find some interesting clues? (Keep playing)"
Dialog_Action_800621501_1,This is the location of the third rune.
Dialog_Action_800621501_2,What are we waiting for? Let's search for it.
Dialog_Action_800621505_1,"Here it is. Because the last rune was taken, this area seems to be collapsing. We need to take this rune quickly and get out of here."
Dialog_Action_800621505_2,Why do I feel like you did it on purpose?
Dialog_Action_800621505_3,Why should I go with you if it's a setup?
Dialog_Action_800621505_4,Maybe you can just walk away?
Dialog_Action_800621505_5,No more talking! Hurry up if you don't want to die here. Avoid fighting on the road. Any delay will bury us here.
Dialog_Action_800621108_1,The concealment is almost done. It's time to go deeper.
Dialog_Action_800621108_2,There is a growing sense of danger.
Dialog_Action_800622101_1,Look what Khajiit found! The blue-skinned goblins!
Dialog_Action_800622101_2,The goblins have been transformed by magic. Trust me now?
Dialog_Action_800622101_3,Has Khajiit ever not trusted you?
Dialog_Action_800622101_4,A kitten who likes to lie is not cute.
Dialog_Action_800622301_1,The Khajiit has felt the rune fluctuations in here as well.
Dialog_Action_800622301_2,You're right. The runes here were from me.
Dialog_Action_800622301_3,Get it yourself. We will not search for you.
Dialog_Action_800622301_4,"(Looking up at the ceiling, as if his gaze could see through the buildings to the starry sky, the one of his home, he lets out a sigh.) Alas, it was too long ago, I can only feel it's in this area."
Dialog_Action_800622301_5,Is it on the ceiling?
Dialog_Action_800622301_6,"......No, go find it?"
Dialog_Action_800622303_1,This is it. Get in.
Dialog_Action_800622303_2,No danger?
Dialog_Action_800622303_3,There should be a small ice cube guarding that place. It's not a problem for us.
Dialog_Action_800622102_1,Do you smell anything stinky?
Dialog_Action_800622102_2,It's the smell of rotting flesh. I guess that guy's evil pet is nearby.
Dialog_Action_800622102_3,"Hiss. It's not some cute little animal, right?"
Dialog_Action_800622102_4,It should find you quite cute.
Dialog_Action_800622103_1,Why are there more and more trolls! How many of them does have?!?!
Dialog_Action_800622103_2,There should not have been many of them. They probably escaped and began reproducing during my sleep.
Dialog_Action_800622103_3,Which means you don't know how many of them we will encounter?
Dialog_Action_800622103_4,"Yes, be extremely careful."
Dialog_Action_800622106_1,Is there any end to it?!?! Khajiit is going to be pissed! These trolls and blue goblins cannot be wiped out!
Dialog_Action_800622106_2,"Then we'll find a way to get around. Quickly, something's not right here."
Dialog_Action_800622106_3,Wasn't you who led the way?
Dialog_Action_800622106_4,Then let's go find the runes to unlock this maze of magical creatures.
Dialog_Action_800622401_1,The trolls have changed this place into their lair. Looks like there should be a rune.
Dialog_Action_800622401_2,"Oooh, Khajiit feels freezing here!"
Dialog_Action_800622401_3,"Yeah, it's cold in here."
Dialog_Action_800622404_1,"Here it is. No surprise. There's a little ice cube here, too. How nostalgic!"
Dialog_Action_800622404_2,(Pretending to be frightened) Do you mean the frost giant?
Dialog_Action_800622404_3,"Yea, the little creatures I summoned when I started to learn magic as a kid."
Dialog_Action_800622404_4,Why did those frost giants attack you before?
Dialog_Action_800622404_5,Maybe they forgot about me.
Dialog_Action_800622107_1,"It's freezing in here, too. There can't be frost giants here, right? How many did you summon?"
Dialog_Action_800622107_2,"Maybe there is a lot of them. I was competing with a guy to summon the most giants. I can't remember how many we summoned, it was too long ago."
Dialog_Action_800622107_3,What a waste of time!...how can you use magic like this?
Dialog_Action800622501_1,Did Khajiit attack the goblin lair? Boring and annoying!
Dialog_Action800622501_2,"Patience, Kitten. The last rune in this area was taken by the trolls and goblins. We have to take it and move on."
Dialog_Action800622505_1,Khajiit smells the scent of the small ice cube. This should be the place!
Dialog_Action800622505_2,"There are a lot of creatures in here, so be careful."
Dialog_Action_800622108_1,"Here it is, the last magical formation spell in the area."
Dialog_Action_800622108_2,"If we break the magical formation spell here, we will be able to complete this area, right?"
Dialog_Action_800622108_3,"Yea, take this place as the last chance to practice because the enemies we encounter next will be more than just creatures."
Dialog_Action_800623101_1,Is that your receptionist ahead. They don't look friendly.
Dialog_Action_800623101_2,They have little consciousness and are just repeating the unfinished tasks. Give them a quick death.
Dialog_Action_800623301_1,We are just missing the last rune. Find it then we can go home.
Dialog_Action_800623301_2,...Khajiit doesn't think going back would be good for you guys.
Dialog_Action_800623301_3,Insisting on obsession does not bring salvation. Do what you must do.
Dialog_Action_800623303_1,It seems to have the same powerful vibe as you do here. Khajiit is not feeling well.
Dialog_Action_800623303_2,"Yeah, he's here. Maybe it's just a part of him watching over the runes."
Dialog_Action_800623303_3,"You can take care of him, right?"
Dialog_Action_800623303_4,"Yeah, I should be able to finish him off."
Dialog_Action_800623102_1,There seem to be many agitated ghosts wandering around here.
Dialog_Action_800623102_2,They were beautiful when they were alive.
Dialog_Action_800623102_3,What are you talking about? Khajiit didn't understand.
Dialog_Action_800623102_4,Nothing. Just move on.
Dialog_Action_800623104_1,You've been looking more and more out of shape since meeting those ghosts.
Dialog_Action_800623104_2,(Murmuring) They were really beautiful when were alive.
Dialog_Action_800623104_3,"Khajiit is sure he heard it, he suspects you have a connection to them."
Dialog_Action_800623104_4,Shut up.
Dialog_Action_800623401_1,Surprised it's not here. Is it possible that the rune here no longer exists?
Dialog_Action_800623401_2,"I'm not sure, but something is wrong with the ghoul soldiers across the street."
Dialog_Action_800623401_3,They have recognized me.
Dialog_Action_800623401_4,You seem to be quite unpopular with them. They are rushing over one after another.
Dialog_Action_800623401_5,"Then send them to Songaard. Oh, no, they don't deserve it."
Dialog_Action_800623404_1,Let's go. The rune is in the room below.
Dialog_Action_800623404_2,What makes you so certain. It's as if you put it here yourself.
Dialog_Action_800623404_3,I don't know. My brain just remembers this clearly.
Dialog_Action_800623501_1,The deeper part of my consciousness guided me to this place. Looks like the last rune is here.
Dialog_Action_800623501_2,Why does this seem to be a trap for Khajiit?
Dialog_Action_800623501_3,"What's the matter? Are you scared, kitty?"
Dialog_Action_800623501_4,Khajiit is not scared. Are you alright by the way?
Dialog_Action_800623501_5,"Of course, I am. I've done too many things like this during my lifetime."
Dialog_Action_800623501_6,Then let's go.
Dialog_Action_800623505_1,Are you all right? Seems that your inner ghost is burning!
Dialog_Action_800623505_2,It's another shell here. Why did it come out?
Dialog_Action_800623505_3,Maybe it's afraid of you?
Dialog_Action_800623505_4,"Why, why, why! !"
Dialog_Action_800623505_5,Calm down. You seem off. Did you feel something?
Dialog_Action_800623505_6,My emotions and magic are going out of control.
Dialog_Action_800623505_7,Khajiit think that one should face the problem in order to solve it.
Dialog_Action_800623505_8,Move on if that’s the case.
Dialog_Action_800623105_1,"Temple guards? They have awakened, too. We are about to meet the boss."
Dialog_Action_800623105_2,Your state of mind has changed a lot since you destroyed that shell before.
Dialog_Action_800623105_3,Really? Maybe this is the state of mind I should be in.
Dialog_Action_800623106_1,"Yoo-hoo, the wronged maid! What about we keep their souls locked up just for appreciation?"
Dialog_Action_800623106_2,What's the matter with you? That idea is insane!
Dialog_Action_800623106_3,"What's wrong with it? They were my maids in life, so it's part of their glory to continue serving me after death."
Dialog_Action_800623106_4,You're not right. It's not just me but your little ice cubes also think you're not right in the head!
Dialog_Action_800623106_5,"Hmph, they are just abandoned toys. I can just wave my hand and destroy them."
Dialog_Action_800623107_1,Traitors! Why betray me? I was working on your immortality!
Dialog_Action_800623107_2,What are you mad about? Is your brain damaged?
Dialog_Action_800623107_3,"Kitty, run away while I can still control myself. Find it, it's trying to assimilate me."
Dialog_Action_800623107_4,"Okay, okay, okay, don't go wild. Khajiit will take you to move forward."
Dialog_Action_800623108_1,"It's here, it's right here, but there's so many, so many, so many, destroy it, destroy it now!"
Dialog_Action_800623108_2,Um...all of the rooms are filled with a scent similar to yours. Tricky!
Dialog_Action_800623108_3,"Go destroy them. No matter how strong or weak they are, no matter how many they are. Just destroy them. They are going to devour me. They are not me!"
Dialog_Action_800623108_4,But they are exactly the same as you. You have to hold on. Khajiit does not want you to sneak up on me from behind later.
Dialog_Action_800623108_5,Up ahead is the end of everything. Perhaps you will meet many of me. Don't hesitate. Wipe them all out.
Dialog_Action_800623108_6,"I will keep my word, and when this is over I would like you to stay in this land and spread magic, Kitty."
Dialog_Action_800623108_7,"Are you giving me your last words? No need for that. Khajiit doesn't suspect you anymore, though you are very scary and strange right now. Let's talk about it later when everything ends."
Dialog_Action_800623108_8,You're about to face your nemesis. Cheer up!
Dialog_Action_800623108_9,"(Muffled laughter) Maybe it never existed, it was just me from beginning."
Dialog_Action_800623108_10,Hmm? What do you mean?
Dialog_Action_800623108_11,"(Straightens his decaying priest garb, lifting their head as if he's looking at someone)"
Dialog_Action_800623108_12,"After being observed for so long, I think it is time to end this drama."
Dialog_Action_800623108_13,"Inexplicability, mysterious. Are these the bad habits of magicians from ancient times? Sober from time to time."
Dialog_Action_990700391_1,"Private Kells, reporting for duty! There are signs of mutant movements not far ahead. Shall we continue the operation? Please give an order!"
Dialog_Action_990700391_2,"Great, Kells! You're in good spirits! Keep moving. Finish these scumbags that are threatening the wasteland!"
Dialog_Action_990700391_3,"Yes, sir! Keep moving! Cleanse the wasteland, remove the obstacles, and tackle dangers for the Brotherhood."
Dialog_Action_990700391_4,"Show your fighting ability, Private. Don't let me down!"
Dialog_Action_990700391_5,"Yes, sir! Sir!"
Dialog_Action_990700392_1,Here he is! That traitor!
Dialog_Action_990700392_2,I heard the word traitor. You seem to have some misunderstanding about me!
Dialog_Action_990700392_3,You can weasel your way out of this one. You stole the pre-apocalyptic technology we searched so hard for and sabotaged the warehouse!
Dialog_Action_990700392_4,What if I told you that was my mission? Just as you have insisted.
Dialog_Action_990700392_5,What do you mean? Aren't you a paladin?
Dialog_Action_990700392_6,"They cannot just take over, and what's more, this ""man"" is becoming very strong."
Dialog_Action_990700392_7,What the heck are you?
Dialog_Action_990700392_8,Call us Enclave.
Dialog_Action_990700392_9,In that case...we can't let you go!
Dialog_Action_990700393_1,"Lieutenant Kells, the new Knight Squad is under your command."
Dialog_Action_990700393_2,"No, you are not under my command. Fight along with me in the battle."
Dialog_Action_990700393_3,But you are a lieutenant. You can't be in danger!
Dialog_Action_990700393_4,"If I cannot set an example, how am I qualified to instruct you?"
Dialog_Action_990700394_1,The inferior Synths that intelligence reported are out here.
Dialog_Action_990700394_2,"Yes, Captain Kells, we've never seen this technology before. These Synth are very powerful in combat."
Dialog_Action_990700394_3,What is their purpose? Did they ever think of using this technology to benefit the wasteland?
Dialog_Action_990700394_4,Maybe they hate humans.
Dialog_Action_990700394_5,They trying to replace real humans with Synths?
Dialog_Action_990700394_6,What makes a human is that we possess more than just the image and behavior of a human. They may awaken their consciousness but the emotions and beliefs that humans possess are beyond the reach of the machines.
Dialog_Action_990700394_7,"They may have the value of existence, but they are just uncontrollable scraps."
Dialog_Action_990700395_1,"Boys, this may be the most formidable enemy you have faced since you joined the Brotherhood."
Dialog_Action_990700395_2,They are nothing but a bunch of Raiders who roam the wasteland?
Dialog_Action_990700395_3,"Soldier, watch your words! It could cost you your life! They are one of the most formidable enemies of wasteland"
Dialog_Action_990700395_4,Please tell us in detail what exactly is so scary about them.
Dialog_Action_990700395_5,"They have the same class system as we do, almost the same firepower setup as ours, and they have advanced battle tactics."
Dialog_Action_990700395_6,Does that mean that we are facing an army with great combat skills like us?
Dialog_Action_990700395_7,"It's not that bad. Don't worry too much! Their combat power is only focused on the “traitors”.  Once we wipe them out, the rest are no more than scattered bits of sand."
Dialog_Action_990700395_8,So this operation is actually a shoot to kill mission.
Dialog_Action_990700395_9,"Yes, get ready, and get moving!"
Dialog_Action_990700396_1,"From now on you will be a hunter, assigned number Z2-47. Your primary mission is to hunt down the escaping synths."
Dialog_Action_990700396_2,What do I do now?
Dialog_Action_990700396_3,"You have just spawned, so you can't assess your fighting ability and environmental adaptability. We will leave these wasteland creatures for you to practice on."
Dialog_Action_990700396_4,You will be satisfied.
Dialog_Action_990700397_1,"The last place that the escaping synth appeared would have been here, which is full of wasteland creatures and Raiders. I guess she might have been torn apart."
Dialog_Action_990700397_2,"Hey, stand still! Are you with that woman?"
Dialog_Action_990700397_3,That woman? Haven't you guys finished her already?
Dialog_Action_990700397_4,"Looks like you're with her. She got away, so you will die instead of her!"
Dialog_Action_990700397_5,This doesn't make any sense. Let me just finish you trash off all at once.
Dialog_Action_990700398_1,"Damn, so fast, she got away, but this is the end for you!"
Dialog_Action_990700398_2,Look! Her friends are here! He is coming to destroy us. Don't give him the chance. We have to strike first. Take him out!
Dialog_Action_990700398_3,"Are you guys out of your minds! I'm here to hunt her down, too!"
Dialog_Action_990700398_4,He said we haven’t lost our minds! He must be here to destroy us! And curse us! Beat him up!
Dialog_Action_990700398_5,Enough!
Dialog_Action_990700399_1,Get him! He's here to save the woman!
Dialog_Action_990700399_2,"Wait, I haven't said anything yet! Why do you think I come to save her?"
Dialog_Action_990700399_3,Exactly! The features are the same. The gun also has the Institute's mark! That's him!
Dialog_Action_990700399_4,Did you guys misunderstand something!
Dialog_Action_990700399_5,Misunderstand? Your friends have killed many of us! She said that someone from the Institute would come to save her before escaping. We've been waiting for you for a long time!
Dialog_Action_990700399_6,Why have they all have lost their minds?
Dialog_Action_990700400_1,"Finally, I've got you! You will not run away from me!"
Dialog_Action_990700400_2,How can you be sure that you caught me and not that I caught you?
Dialog_Action_990700400_3,What do you mean?
Dialog_Action_990700400_4,"I have a lot of ""friends"" here. They might give you good greeting"
Dialog_Action_990700400_5,Are you afraid to fight me? Are you terrified that you'll become a pile of scraps back at the Institute?
Dialog_Action_990700400_6,"I'll admit my defeat if you can catch me. However, it’s more likely that you will end up being scrapped."
Dialog_Action_990700400_7,Are you saying you're hunting me?
Dialog_Action_990700400_8,"This is what you call ""prey"", hunter."
Dialog_Action_990700400_9,"Damn, just wait there, I will come to you soon!"
Dialog_Action_990700381_1,"(Humming) Walk, walk in the swamp. A silent confession comes in, what do I ask for, I ask to be as barren as money, but I know that I am a good neighbor, a really good neighbor."
Dialog_Action_990700381_2,I definitely know you are a good neighbor and I have some ideas on how to make money.
Dialog_Action_990700381_3,"(Humming) Floating in the water like a swan, as swept by mutants this pond, that can only bring back remains of buried stories. This is what I do all day. This is my responsibility to be as a good neighbor."
Dialog_Action_990700381_4,"Well, okay, I get it. We're about to fight super mutants."
Dialog_Action_990700382_1,"(Humming) That shake is like an earthquake that makes the world tremble and uncontrollable. The collapse of this world is about to begin. Oh, my darling, all I have around me is you."
Dialog_Action_990700382_2,"(Whispering) Yes, I was surrounded only by you, my dear, and little Sean."
Dialog_Action_990700382_3,"(Humming) Help me, help me, save my heart! Hold me tight, hold me tight, don't let me fall apart! Take me with you, take me with you, dear, don't leave me behind! You have the power to save me."
Dialog_Action_990700382_4,"(Murmuring in pain) Nora, I couldn't save you, but little Sean, I will find you for sure!"
Dialog_Action_990700383_1,"(Humming) The world knows that you've been training and training, for the sake of being able to live in the future, but it's a game, a game! We got on a train to the abyss in this game."
Dialog_Action_990700383_2,"(Silently I wipe the gun, slowly I hum along)"
Dialog_Action_990700383_3,"(Humming) When you fear to go forward, can't go backward, relax, you better relax, wherever you are, throw yourself a party, leave your sorrows behind, get ready for tomorrow and find your way back to civilization again."
Dialog_Action_990700383_4,(Picking up the gun) Let's go and find the way back to civilization.
Dialog_Action_990700384_1,"(Humming) My arms want to hold you tight, my charms will drive you crazy in the night, I have everything you want, but I want a guy with manhood."
Dialog_Action_990700384_2,Are you referring to me? It has to be me. I am the man with the manhood.
Dialog_Action_990700384_3,"(Humming) You have your own style, you should also have your own charm! Give a smile that I can't resist, if you're a gentle and strong man, then you're the man with manhood."
Dialog_Action_990700384_4,What if I change my style?
Dialog_Action_990700384_5,We are the men with manhood! Our manhood is spilling over!
Dialog_Action_990700384_6,Shut up! Nasty things!
Dialog_Action_990700385_1,"(Humming) Don't stand around the corner and watch quietly, come on in and sit down. Don’t act like a stranger because truthfully, we are all strangers."
Dialog_Action_990700385_2,It's all the same for us actually. You deserve to have your own life.
Dialog_Action_990700385_3,(Humming) Is your heart empty? Are you running away from yourself? Are you wishing for a new life? Are you longing to be a new person?
Dialog_Action_990700385_4,"That would be the best for you, but you also have to deal with the people who want to stop you first."
Dialog_Action_990700386_1,New recruit Tara reporting for duty. For the win!
Dialog_Action_990700386_2,"Very impressive, soldier! Next, we will sweep the ruins to practice the mission’s like a brotherhood member!"
Dialog_Action_990700386_3,"Roger that, Paladin!"
Dialog_Action_990700387_1,"There are a lot of Raider snipers hiding in the shadows ahead, so it's all on you again, Tara!"
Dialog_Action_990700387_2,"Received, Captain, I will sweep the enemies from the shadows. Keep safe, please. For the win!"
Dialog_Action_990700387_3,"What a reliable teammate. Tara, you will definitely become a paladin someday."
Dialog_Action_990700387_4,"Thanks for your kind words, Captain! I'll keep working hard!"
Dialog_Action_990700388_1,"Tara, this is your first battle and test since becoming a Paladin."
Dialog_Action_990700388_2,Consider it done! For the Brotherhood! For the win!
Dialog_Action_990700388_3,"If you complete this mission, we will assign you to the Artemis Squad for secret missions. Don't disappoint us!"
Dialog_Action_990700388_4,I won't! You have my promise!
Dialog_Action_990700389_1,"Officer Brandys, do you copy? Do you copy?"
Dialog_Action_990700389_2,Still no reply? It seems like they are also in big trouble.
Dialog_Action_990700389_3,"Yes, but we can't give up. We have to break through and join them. We can't die here."
Dialog_Action_990700389_4,(Lifting the gun) For the win. Move!
Dialog_Action_990700390_1,"Farhan, Faris, Malden, Officer Brandys, please reply, anyone there?"
Dialog_Action_990700390_2,"(Full image cassette message) Tara, hold the National Training Ground. We'll meet there. Head there and hold it by all means!"
Dialog_Action_990700390_3,"Captain, where are you guys? I've taken control of the place, but...I can't hold it any longer."
Dialog_Action_990700390_4,"(Voice in her head) Tara, believe in yourself! You were the best new recruit ever."
Dialog_Action_990700390_5,(Voice in her head) Paladin! Where's the faith of the Brotherhood? For the win! Look at you now!
Dialog_Action_990700390_6,"(Reloading) Yea, I'm a paladin of the Brotherhood. For the win!"

Dialog_Action_990700405_3,"""Ow-wooo""! Hoo?"

Dialog_Action_990700408_2,"Honey, you're back! Come on! Surprise! Do you really think that's all you have to fear?"
Dialog_Action_990700408_3,"I, will never give in!"
Dialog_Action_990700408_4,Do not struggle. Wasn't dad always powerful in your heart? Don't resist. Just give in. You will not get hurt!
Dialog_Action_990700408_5,"No, never!"
Dialog_Action_990700409_1,Stratton! You beast! I am not a toy! I am conscious! I am a human!
Dialog_Action_990700409_2,"No, you're not. Heehee, you're just a toy! You're a woman attached to us. Your disobedience is rebellion, it's munity!"
Dialog_Action_990700409_3,I'll! Never! Obey!
Dialog_Action_990700409_4,"Heeheehee! If you obey, you will only be mine. Not like now, a toy for everyone. Heeheehee!"
Dialog_Action_990700409_5,"If you are all dead, then I will not obey anyone!"
Dialog_Action_990700410_1,She is strong and stubborn. She has exploited her body and mind to a great extent over the years in order to hold on. She can barely hold on anymore.
Dialog_Action_990700410_2,"It is her way of venting that is wrong. I will take her away to vent in the wasteland, and find a way to heal her."
Dialog_Action_990700410_3,"She is a wounded bird, sensitive and emotional, she may peck at you, are you really ready for that?"
Dialog_Action_990700410_4,"Don't worry about that. I have a lot of  ""Critters"" around me."
Dialog_Action_990700411_1,"Whoa whoa whoa! Jangles, look what you did!"
Dialog_Action_990700411_2,"Captain, it seems that you are drawn into the anomaly point. The surrounding space is not stable and may shift at any time!"
Dialog_Action_990700411_3,"Jangles! Look what you've done! Hold on! Skyfire, how are you and the airship alright? Why is it just Jangles and me here?"
Dialog_Action_990700411_4,"Um, sorry, captain! Actually, we left the ship when it was headed to the anomaly point."
Dialog_Action_990700411_5,You! I'll deal with you when I get back. Now let’s have the ship come in and pick us up.
Dialog_Action_990700411_6,"I can't do this, either. The ship is still stuck at the outer area of the anomaly point. It doesn't seem to be able to teleport through the anomaly point, which is very strange."
Dialog_Action_990700411_7,The communication equipment is still working. It seems we have to solve this anomaly point problem in order to leave.
Dialog_Action_990700411_8,"If I am right, you have returned to the ship, correct? Get busy and give me support. Give me a direction!"
Dialog_Action_990700411_9,"Of course, but captain, you may not have time to chat with me now. The owner has come to say hello. Why don't you ""interact"" with them?"
Dialog_Action_990700411_10,"Oh no, the owners look...unique!"
Dialog_Action_990700412_1,"Skyfire, Skyfire, please respond, please respond."
Dialog_Action_990700412_2,"Captain, just say it once and keep your voice down. I can hear you!"
Dialog_Action_990700412_3,Where are we now? What was the sudden teleportation?
Dialog_Action_990700412_4,The space is unstable. You guys have got to be careful! The teleportation just now seems to have teleported some other guys to your location.
Dialog_Action_990700412_5,No need to be careful now. I'm right here. What are you guys?
Dialog_Action_990700412_6,Who's that? Jangles! Scratch him!
Dialog_Action_990700412_7,Get your monkey off. I mean no harm!
Dialog_Action_990700412_8,No harm? You think I didn't see what you were holding under your robe?
Dialog_Action_990700412_9,"Okay, I'm letting go. Tell your monkey to get back!"
Dialog_Action_990700412_10,"Captain, Captain! Stop it! Don't you hear the alarm!"
Dialog_Action_990700412_11,Shut up and keep quiet. I can hear you! Didn't you see the strange person next to me?
Dialog_Action_990700412_12,"I'm not a strange man, but it's not the time for arguing. Let's deal with these ugly aliens first!"
Dialog_Action_990700412_13,All right. Let's deal with the enemies first!
Dialog_Action_990700413_1,Damn. That strange man has run away! Something was wrong with him!
Dialog_Action_990700413_2,"Forget the guy from before, at least he didn't mean any harm. It's not bad to have some friendly people in this spooky place."
Dialog_Action_990700413_3,"Yeah, but we have to be careful. They might have faked it. Wait, how many of them are there? How many others?"
Dialog_Action_990700413_4,"Well, there are two more, one with a yellow outfit with underpants on the outside, and the other is in a detective suit."
Dialog_Action_990700413_5,"Hahahahaha, wearing underpants on the outside. Where is this superman from?"
Dialog_Action_990700413_6,From the sea. And these are pants actually... You guys really good at talking about people behind their backs?
Dialog_Action_990700413_7,Whoa! Where are you from? From the pool over there? Are you a frog?
Dialog_Action_990700413_8,It's mobula! Have you met my friend?
Dialog_Action_990700413_9,"You mean the strange man in the black suit? Yeah, we met him. But after we dealt with some aliens, he was gone."
Dialog_Action_990700413_10,That would be him. There is something odd about these aliens since he disappeared.
Dialog_Action_990700413_11,So let's go capture some more for fun?
Dialog_Action_990700413_12,Sure! I'll hold them under water and we can see how long these freaks hold out.
Dialog_Action_990700414_1,"Skyfire, find out where the dead fish in yellow clothes went! He dissappeard while passing by a pool."
Dialog_Action_990700414_2,"Captain. no need for that. They seem to have found some clues. They are still in this area, though not with you."
Dialog_Action_990700414_3,Why didn’t you give me a heads up you were leaving? If you let me know I could help too!
Dialog_Action_990700414_4,Maybe they think you are a useless person?
Dialog_Action_990700414_5,Shut up! I'd rather they thought I was suspicious!
Dialog_Action_990700414_6,"Well, they just don't trust you! What do you intend to do now?"
Dialog_Action_990700414_7,Is there one more of them? Let's find that person and interrogate him. Maybe we can find out the reason they are here.
Dialog_Action_990700414_8,Where do you expect to find him?
Dialog_Action_990700414_9,I don't know. Maybe we will encounter him at next turn.
Dialog_Action_990700414_10,No need to take the next turn. Your monkey has come to me.
Dialog_Action_990700414_11,"Jangles? When did you go out, Jangles? Come back!"
Dialog_Action_990700414_12,"Smart monkey. If one day you do not want to stay with him, then I will welcome you! A good detective needs a good assistant like you."
Dialog_Action_990700414_13,Bad person. You're fooling a monkey!
Dialog_Action_990700414_14,"Well, it's a joke. I know you have met my friends and they have found some clues. As for the info you want to know, maybe the robot in the room ahead can give some to you."
Dialog_Action_990700414_15,Why should I believe you?
Dialog_Action_990700414_16,"I'll go in with you. Don't worry, I'll go in front of you."
Dialog_Action_990700415_1,I knew something was odd. This place seems to be a holographic simulation of someone's memory! What have you guys found?
Dialog_Action_990700415_2,You have come to ask what we have found? Are you looking up to us or laughing at us?
Dialog_Action_990700415_3,"Alright, don't fight, at least not here."
Dialog_Action_990700415_4,You seem like a good guy and its not because of you. But now we don't even know where the barbarian is.
Dialog_Action_990700415_5,You should worry more about meeting their men rather than them.
Dialog_Action_990700415_6,Excuse me. I'm still here to help. Is there anything I can do? I'm not familiar with this place as it looks pretty run down.
Dialog_Action_990700415_7,How can you offer to help when you're not familiar with it? Don't interrupt us!
Dialog_Action_990700415_8,"I don't really want to, but there's a group of people who look like you coming towards here."
Dialog_Action_990700415_9,Don't worry. They are old friends. Let's meet them together.
Dialog_Action_990700415_10,But they keep saying you guys are ghosts.
Dialog_Action_990700415_11,"We are ghosts? Fine, we won't fail them. Go pull the tubes out of the back of his head!"
Dialog_Action_990700415_12,"Maybe when you guys are done pulling out the tubes, you can give me an explanation of the situation?"
Dialog_Action_990700415_13,"(Whispering) Captain, let's just follow them. It seems that something big is going to happen. This is an adventure we can't miss!"
Dialog_Action_800631101_1,"O man hidden in the shadows, have you noticed that you have come to a familiar place?"
Dialog_Action_800631101_2,It is familiar but not in my mind.
Dialog_Action_800631101_3,Explore the scent buried here. It'll surprise you.
Dialog_Action_800631101_4,"I don't like surprises, nor secretive people!"
Dialog_Action_800631101_5,Your hearth must be full of disdain now. Doesn't matter. Move on. You'll like the feeling of revisiting an old place.
Dialog_Action_800631103_1,This red rocket seems familiar. Have I really been here before?
Dialog_Action_800631103_2,"(Electrical stream) Mayday, mayday."
Dialog_Action_800631103_3,I used to hear it but not with the electrical stream.
Dialog_Action_800631103_4,"(A bizarre laughter comes in after the call for help) Gee, hahahahaha, geegee, such a delicious tempting drink, geegeegee."
Dialog_Action_800631103_5,"Something is up with that laughter! The voice is familiar, but the laughter...I need to check it out!"
Dialog_Action_800631301_1,(Radio) Rob Tech is committed to bringing you more powerful firepower and a safer living environment. What are you waiting for? Buy your exclusive weapons now!
Dialog_Action_800631301_2,(Weighing the submachine gun in hands) It's time for a refit.
Dialog_Action_800631301_3,"(Radio) Of course, if you can take it away."
Dialog_Action_800631303_1,"(Radio) Rob...Tech...is committed to...more powerful..., ...take....your...firepower!"
Dialog_Action_800631303_2,"Weird radio, take me?"
Dialog_Action_800631303_3,"(Radio) Your choice, best choice, we will...absolutely...you...in...peace!"
Dialog_Action_800631303_4,Interesting. It might be a trap or is it the radio that has a problem?
Dialog_Action_800631303_5,"(Radio) If you have any questions, please come to the consultation desk. We will be happy to help!"
Dialog_Action_800631105_1,Was it really her? The person that I saw by the lake?
Dialog_Action_800631105_2,*********
Dialog_Action_800631105_3,"Where did the current stream come from? Am I getting it wrong? Is that you, Shannon?"
Dialog_Action_800631105_4,***come***find***me***
Dialog_Action_800631105_5,Puzzling! It's you that gave me the message.Could it be...there is something that you can't say? I'm speeding up!
Dialog_Action_800631106_1,I lost her! That would be Shannon though she has an awkward walk.
Dialog_Action_800631106_2,"Something is not right here, my senses are sharp but I have lost my sense of direction. Something is definitely not right. I need to get out of here as soon as possible."
Dialog_Action_800631106_3,"This is Shannon's handwriting, it looks neat, so the situation is not urgent. What exactly has she encountered?"
Dialog_Action_800631106_4,The air here suggests a crisis may be hiding here. I have to move on!
Dialog_Action_800631401_1,(Radio)Powerful refit...help...you...get...killed...
Dialog_Action_800631401_2,"(Shooting the recorder) Okay, I got it. I'll kill you first."
Dialog_Action_800631404_1,Interesting. The setup here is really designed to get people killed.
Dialog_Action_800631404_2,(Radio)Welcome. Please feel free to select...please...free...
Dialog_Action_800631404_3,"The stuff on you seems good, too. I'll get them if you don't mind."
Dialog_Action_800631107_1,"There are some Raiders ahead, praying...? !"
Dialog_Action_800631107_2,&……*￥#@！ %￥
Dialog_Action_800631107_3,I don’t understand what they are praying for. Let's grab one of them and ask!
Dialog_Action_800631107_4,Ahh! I see! ! ! Ahhhhhhh!
Dialog_Action_800631107_5,Forget it. We can't get any good info out of them.
Dialog_Action_800631501_1,(Radio)Break...your...armor...
Dialog_Action_800631501_2,Thanks for the reminder. I really need to patch the clothes.
Dialog_Action_800631505_1,(Radio ) Armor Destroyer. Go!
Dialog_Action_800631505_2,Impressive. They just blurted out their info.
Dialog_Action_800631505_3,&……*￥#@！ %￥
Dialog_Action_800631505_4,At least say something we can understand! Wait. That thing behind you guys looks awesome!
Dialog_Action_800631108_1,We couldn't find a route at the edge of the city. Let's go deeper. I hope he's coming.
Dialog_Action_800631108_2,"Shanon, wait for me!"
Dialog_Action_800632101_1,How come the Raiders look more and more strange the farther we go?
Dialog_Action_800632101_2,"(Crying and laughing) Hahahaha, Boo hoo hoo, kill ....Kill...kill!"
Dialog_Action_800632101_3,Something’s wrong!
Dialog_Action_800632101_4,"(Laughing and rushing over, pleading) Kill...kill...me!"
Dialog_Action_800632301_1,This is a scrapyard? Sure enough this is the old town.
Dialog_Action_800632301_2,Raider! We won't allow you to take away our treasure!
Dialog_Action_800632301_3,Raider? You mean me?
Dialog_Action_800632301_4,Thief! Raider! Murderer! Get out!
Dialog_Action_800632301_5,(Sneering) You call me a murderer? The thing I killed was not a human!
Dialog_Action_800632303_1,The murderer is here! Finish him off! We can't allow him to take away our treasure!
Dialog_Action_800632303_2,How did they detect me? Who told them that?
Dialog_Action_800632303_3,The God was correct! The murderer is really here! Finish him off!
Dialog_Action_800632102_1,"I don't know if the message that was left can be found. In this town, one has to be careful of the lights, there seems to be something watching us behind the extinguished lights!"
Dialog_Action_800632102_2,(Looking up at the light overhead) There's nothing unusual about it! Is Shannon scared by something? She shouldn't be.
Dialog_Action_800632102_3,Hope the guy that likes to hide in shadows is OK. There is something else here hiding in the shadows.
Dialog_Action_800632102_4,"(Snap, the light overhead extinguished, looking down at the shadows that were gathering underneath) So this is it? Well, it's no use hiding all the time."
Dialog_Action_800632103_1,"Hey, there's someone here."
Dialog_Action_800632103_2,"Who are you? (Moving feet) How come, wherever I go,  I can't see you?"
Dialog_Action_800632103_3,Save your breath. I am no one and can be anyone. I know you have a lot to ask. Just keep exploring. You will find the answers.
Dialog_Action_800632103_4,Hold it! Make it clear to me!
Dialog_Action_800632106_1,"(It seems that someone is whispering, chanting unknown sounds, scattered within current stream, conveying unspeakable power and fear)"
Dialog_Action_800632106_2,"Damn, what the hell is this? What is this voice trying to convey to me?"
Dialog_Action_800632106_3,(A whisper that doesn't belong to him coming out of his mouth) Evil is growing. Our power has not yet been restored. You humans will join this fight as variables. Fulfill your duty. I hope we made the right choice.
Dialog_Action_800632106_4,(The echo in their head fades away) What do you mean?? We're just pawns. That's not funny. What the heck is going on?
Dialog_Action_800632401_1,There should be some refit parts here if it is like the previous situation.
Dialog_Action_800632401_2,Kill...? !! !!
Dialog_Action_800632401_3,These Raiders are even stranger. Forget them. They are not important. Just get them out of my way while I search.
Dialog_Action_800632404_1,"My dear, my sweetie, don't be afraid! We have thrown away the terrible bad things."
Dialog_Action_800632404_2,What on earth has made you like this? So confused between right and wrong. It can happen even you are a Raider!
Dialog_Action_800632404_3,"Hon, are you saying he's bad, too? Bad things must be destroyed! Destroyed! Destroyed!"
Dialog_Action_800632404_4,It's beyond salvation now! Leave the stuff and go!
Dialog_Action_800632107_1,Why are you here?
Dialog_Action_800632107_2,"Didn't you send leave a message asking me to come here? No, you're not Shannon? No, you...you...are Shannon, but...not really..."
Dialog_Action_800632107_3,(The corners of his eyes and mouth are twisted as if trying to convey something) Since...go...you...I...wait for you!
Dialog_Action_800632107_4,"(A twinge in the brain, then look up and find no one) Is this an illusion? Darn. Shannon is definitely here. I have to find out what's going on!"
Dialog_Action800632501_1,The Raiders should have been here. They might want to bury something here. I'll check it out!
Dialog_Action800632501_2,The murderer is here! Stop him! We can't allow him to take away the offerings to the Lord God!
Dialog_Action800632505_1,It's a shame to bury such useful technologies!
Dialog_Action800632505_2,Stop him! Stop him! The Lord God is getting angry! We're all going to die! ! ! !
Dialog_Action_800632108_1,Shannon! Where are you!
Dialog_Action_800632108_2,She's gone. There's only me left. She's not coming back. She belongs to the city and to me now.
Dialog_Action_800632108_3,"I'll take it back if that's the case. At least, I should stay here with her!"
Dialog_Action_800633101_1,What is this place? I can't believe I lost consciousness after that fight!
Dialog_Action_800633101_2,Congratulations on finding the secret route. You will have a completely different experience in the park. Enjoy the game!
Dialog_Action_800633101_3,What...does this mean?
Dialog_Action_800633301_1,What is this place? It seems that there are a lot of technological parts down here. It is always best to be more prepared for the unknown.
Dialog_Action_800633301_2,I never thought it would be found via a secret entrance.
Dialog_Action_800633301_3,Why didn't you just hide the entrance? Or did you just want it to be found?
Dialog_Action_800633303_1,Move this stuff now! The man in the windbreaker will be here soon!
Dialog_Action_800633303_2,Too late. Put your stuff down!
Dialog_Action_800633303_3,Bastard! I'll fight! It is better to die than to be tortured!
Dialog_Action_800633303_4,What do you mean? Make it clear before fighting!
Dialog_Action_800633102_1,"Please stop where you are. Please. I don't want to die, we all don't want to die!"
Dialog_Action_800633102_2,"Okay, I'm not leaving. Tell me what happened and who it is that is after you."
Dialog_Action_800633102_3,"It's...it's...I can't tell you! Ahh! No, no, no, I'm going to betray! Bahahaha, I didn't. Bahahaha. Die. Monster!"
Dialog_Action_800633102_4,"...I'm OK with you going crazy. But, can you make clarify this first?"
Dialog_Action_800633104_1,"Hold this place. We must not let the one in the windbreaker through. Otherwise, we all will be killed!"
Dialog_Action_800633104_2,I won't pass but you have to tell me why. Make it clear before a fight! Don't act like the ones from before.
Dialog_Action_800633104_3,"He's coming! Kill him! Ahh! ""Ow-wooo""! (No humanity can be seen from his eyes of madness, even his voice is human)."
Dialog_Action_800633104_4,I really didn't expect it. I probably know who did it!
Dialog_Action_800633401_1,"Am I going in the wrong way? Wait, my memory works, there should be a warehouse ahead."
Dialog_Action_800633401_2,"Hehe, if we move the stuff here, then Death will not discover it."
Dialog_Action_800633401_3,"Death, I like this title!"
Dialog_Action_800633401_4,Run! Death's here! Death's here to loot!
Dialog_Action_800633401_5,"Hey! Not really, not really, It's you that called me Death, and I like it. Slow down. Don't hit your head!"
Dialog_Action_800633404_1,The good stuff should be right here. But it's quite strange that a power is guiding me here.
Dialog_Action_800633404_2,How did you find this place? It's like you put all this stuff here yourself.
Dialog_Action_800633404_3,"I can't remember, either. But you are right, I am going to take the stuff away now."
Dialog_Action_800633501_1,The depths of consciousness led me here. It seems that once it was me that stored something here that I might want to use it later.
Dialog_Action_800633501_2,It's all useless stuff here! Why are you still coming here!
Dialog_Action_800633501_3,"It's not up to you to determine whether it's useful or not. Wait, there's nothing here!"
Dialog_Action_800633501_4,"Yeah! Nothing's here! You'd better go! Just don't come in! We will die otherwise! We will not be killed by you, nor the **!"
Dialog_Action_800633501_5,What is **? Please make it clear! Make it clear! Or I won't leave!
Dialog_Action_800633501_6,Ahhhhhhh! I'll die either way! I'll fight!
Dialog_Action_800633505_1,"This déjà vu feeling is becoming more and more apparent, I really have been here before."
Dialog_Action_800633505_2,"Move forward. Seek the existence in inexistence, seek usefulness in uselessness."
Dialog_Action_800633505_3,What's this? Is it a riddle?
Dialog_Action_800633505_4,The useless stuff seeks the meaning of existence for the useless person. Is it the person is useless or the stuff is useless?
Dialog_Action_800633505_5,Does that make any sense? What the heck does that mean?
Dialog_Action_800633505_6,This place exists to wait for the useful person. Everything here did not exist nor was useful in the past.
Dialog_Action_800633505_7,"In that case, I'll be the useful person to make the items here useful. Maybe that will reach the truth."
Dialog_Action_800633505_8,(Dismissive laughter comes out from electrical stream) Good luck!
Dialog_Action_800633105_1,Was this...once the Skylar Plaza? Why am I here!?
Dialog_Action_800633105_2,"Silver Shroud! Surprised you came out of the shadows! Hahahahaha, a rat hiding in the shadows is daring to come out on the street!"
Dialog_Action_800633105_3,#Go away!
Dialog_Action_800633106_1,What is this place? Ahh! Ahh! My head is aching! Legs are trembling! What's the matter with me?
Dialog_Action_800633106_2,(A statement consisting from an unnameable voice is transmitted)
Dialog_Action_800633106_3,(Voice seems uncontrolled) You have come close to the truth here. You have found the real clues in a world of inexistence. Don't believe anything you see next.
Dialog_Action_800633106_4,Who the heck are you people? Where the heck am I?
Dialog_Action_800633106_5,(A long voice utters in a tone that seemed to indicate for him to move.)
Dialog_Action_800633107_1,Wake up! It's that guy who brainwashed you! Wake up!
Dialog_Action_800633107_2,"No, he's dying! He has to finish what he is doing there before he returns! Stop shaking him!"
Dialog_Action_800633107_3,How about I chop him with an axe?
Dialog_Action_800633107_4,Where are you! Where the heck am I!
Dialog_Action_800633107_5,"(The currents get noisier and noisier) Manta Candy, the candy that keeps you awake, keeps you awake to be yourself!"
Dialog_Action_800633107_6,"No, I'm getting out of here! Something's not right here!"
Dialog_Action_800633108_1,Here is...the odd scent...this...is not right!
Dialog_Action_800633108_2,You're here again? Still not given up?
Dialog_Action_800633108_3,Am I here again? Who are you? It's my first time here!
Dialog_Action_800633108_4,"So many questions. Never mind. As usual, I will answer your questions if you can find me."
Dialog_Action_800633108_5,"(Mixed with the strong electrical current, there is an indescribable murmur)."
Dialog_Action_800633108_6,Ahh! !! Shut up! (Followed by frantic shouting and claps of gunfire. It is as if the whole building is dancing in light and shadow)
Dialog_Action_800633108_7,(A meaningless current followed by a statement that could be understood) Don't be afraid of him. He can hide no longer.
Dialog_Action_800633108_8,Who the heck are you? Who am I going to fight?
Dialog_Action_800633108_9,(Maniacal laughter) False God! Fake faith! How can you hide behind a machine? Come and meet our Lord! You are the illusion!
Dialog_Action_800633108_10,(Shaking head with arms folded) He's right. I'm curious what you are.
Dialog_Action_800633108_11,"(An intermittent sigh comes over the radio.) Maybe I really am an illusion, but we will exist as long as someone has the faith in us."
Dialog_Action_800633108_12,"(Picking up silver submachine gun) All right. I believe in your existence since I can hear you. If I ever confirm that you're an illusion, I'll destroy you myself, but I'm not looking forward to that day."
Dialog_Action_800633108_13,(The words on the radio gradually become clearer) May this day not come. May your wish be achieved. Everything is determined.
Dialog_Action_990700416_1,(Intermittent thoughts) Free...dom...es..cape..pain...n...pay...
Dialog_Action_990700416_2,Warning! Warning! Experimental subject is escaping. Stay alert! Alert! The subject is extremely dangerous!
Dialog_Action_990700417_1,"(Clearing their mind) Human...being, not trusty, not the same, still not trusty"
Dialog_Action_990700417_2,"My friend, you don't seem to be the same as they are. It appears you need help. Don't worry. They can't hurt you with me by your side!"
Dialog_Action_990700417_3,(Stepping back and nodding instinctively)
Dialog_Action_990700418_1,"(Organized thoughts) This is my kind, at least we look almost the same. Maybe we can talk to each other."
Dialog_Action_990700418_2,(Wagging tail excitedly) Woof! Woof!
Dialog_Action_990700418_3,(Also wagging tail excitedly) Great. Very nice! Let's go on an adventure together!
Dialog_Action_990700419_1,"(Realizing a logical conclusion) From biological and intelligence standpoint, this intelligent fellow is obviously different than me. I am more like a machine and should not have emotions."
Dialog_Action_990700419_2,What! What's this? A robot dog! Geez! What a perfect mechanical creation it is! God. What a beautiful body! What an exquisite design!
Dialog_Action_990700419_3,(The mechanical brain is at unease) This man is insane! Absolutely! Insane!
Dialog_Action_990700419_4,Stand still! It's dangerous ahead! Wait for me!
Dialog_Action_990700420_1,(Filled with sadness) What am I? What am I? Neither a creature nor a machine. I'm not tolerated by this world.
Dialog_Action_990700420_2,"Hey, can you talk?"
Dialog_Action_990700420_3,(Mechanical voice) Friend...?
Dialog_Action_990700420_4,"Sure. Are you coming with us, my friend? This Vault will be your new home."
Dialog_Action_990700421_1,Noisy! Who's on the radio in the middle of the night?
Dialog_Action_990700421_2,"Emergency announcement, emergency announcement, do not know who triggered a group of guard robots, robots are sweeping around, please listen to the broadcast and do not move around."
Dialog_Action_990700421_3,"Funny! Oh sorry, that's sad, I think I should be able to fix it!"
Dialog_Action_990700422_1,"Tsk tsk, it's really interesting to study machinery, I wonder if I can make this group of mechanical creations more vivid and lovely like a ""machine master""?"
Dialog_Action_990700422_2,"Emergency announcement, emergency announcement! Another bunch of robots are coming out! Holy crap, what did we do to them?!? No, these robots don't feel the same way! Isabelle!"
Dialog_Action_990700422_3,"My God, the semi-finished product I brought back ran away again! I have to bring them back, I can't let them hurt people, the ""Machine Master"" gives me strength!"
Dialog_Action_990700423_1,"I, Isabel Cruz, am finally in control of the shovels! From now on, I am a machine master!"
Dialog_Action_990700423_2,Please be aware that there have been many incidents of waste soil creatures and ghosts injuring people outside. Please be careful and be safe when you go out. Please bring the necessary weapons and equipment. I hope you can hear the next broadcast.
Dialog_Action_990700423_3,"The machine master should ensure the safety of the wasteland people, it is time to verify the strength of these children!"
Dialog_Action_990700424_1,Here he is! This plant is just perfect!
Dialog_Action_990700424_2,"If you find an unknown visitor, please leave the factory immediately, otherwise your life will be in danger."
Dialog_Action_990700424_3,It's okay! I'll keep it safe!
Dialog_Action_990700425_1,"Let's not fight, my creatures have their own ideas, and I am doing my best to remedy them!"
Dialog_Action_990700425_2,"Destroy everyone you meet, your ambition is not small!"
Dialog_Action_990700425_3,Misunderstand?!?! I'm protecting the wasteland! Transform the wasteland!
Dialog_Action_990700425_4,Remake? A dangerous word! Your method is to destroy the creatures to build a mechanical civilization!
Dialog_Action_990700425_5,No!!!! That's not what I meant! Do machines and humans have to be opposites?
Dialog_Action_990700425_6,"I will follow you to solve this crisis, I will watch your every move!"
Dialog_Action_990700425_7,"I'll prove myself, but you have to prove yourself too!"
Dialog_Action_990700426_1,(Opening his eyes vaguely) This... Where is this? It's so strange. Where is my operating table and my scalpel?
Dialog_Action_990700426_2,"(The sound of electricity is showing) Jie Jie, oh, sorry to laugh, are you familiar with this voice? By the way, did you see the face on the ground?"
Dialog_Action_990700426_3,Who are you! Oh no this is not a face! This is a shoe print! How can this be a face?
Dialog_Action_990700426_4,"(The sound of electricity gradually turns into distorted laughter) Jie Jie, isn't this a familiar face? Don't you step on your feet more?"
Dialog_Action_990700426_5,"No, this must be a nightmare! This ugly must not be a face! This is not a face! I can't see my face! Why don't you have faces! Go away! Let me go back!"
Dialog_Action_990700427_1,Why can't I get out! Why can't I get out! Don't show up again! Go away! How ugly!
Dialog_Action_990700427_2,"Aren't these faces torn by you? You tore it with your own hands. Do you remember how happy you were when you laughed? Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha, just like this happy."
Dialog_Action_990700427_3,"Right, right, right! Tear it up! yes! Tear it up! I want to find my knife, knife knife knife knife knife knife, I want to find my scalpel!!"
Dialog_Action_990700427_4,"Oh, no, hahahahaha, I'm so scared. I need to find a knife! How terrible!"
Dialog_Action_990700428_1,"(Heavy, rhythmic breathing) Why is it not over yet! Ah ah ah ah ah! I've found the knife!"
Dialog_Action_990700428_2,"(Current sound) Jie Jie, oh, dear knife, do you still remember the feeling of cutting the skin, the feeling of breaking facial blood vessels one by one."
Dialog_Action_990700428_3,"Ah ah ah! No! No! Don't cut my face, don't cut my face! I'm not ugly! I'm not ugly!"
Dialog_Action_990700428_4,"No, you are ugly. You need to have plastic surgery. It's not your call!"
Dialog_Action_990700428_5,"No, no, no, no! This is my words! Don't rob! You're all going to die! Dead!"
Dialog_Action_990700429_1,Who can save me... Who can save me
Dialog_Action_990700429_2,"Oh, the doctor is you, you call me?"
Dialog_Action_990700429_3,Who?
Dialog_Action_990700429_4,"Doctor, are you stupid? It's me. Oh, forget, you said my face is not suitable for you."
Dialog_Action_990700429_5,"(It's like waking up suddenly.) Nick, is that you! Nick! Help me, help me!"
Dialog_Action_990700429_6,Do you think you deserve to be saved?
Dialog_Action_990700429_7,"I know it's wrong, I know it's wrong! help me!"
Dialog_Action_990700429_8,(Sighs) Alas
Dialog_Action_990700430_1,"(Suddenly wakes up) Nick, Nick! where are you!"
Dialog_Action_990700430_2,(Rough roar) Bastard! Do you think someone will save you who killed us! no one!
Dialog_Action_990700430_3,No! have People!
Dialog_Action_990700430_4,"No, no, no, no! Let me go! Let me go! I know it's wrong! You all look good!"
Dialog_Action_990700430_5,"Hello, hello, excuse me, is there anyone inside? Can I help you?"
Dialog_Action_990700430_6,Help me! You are a good-looking person! Help me!
Dialog_Action_990700430_7,"If you want me to save you, just shut up! It's creepy to be praised by you."
Dialog_Action_800641101_1,"What!This... I have already uploaded my consciousness, is this my conscious world?"
Dialog_Action_800641101_2,"Who is it? This is Urdak, and why are you here?"
Dialog_Action_800641101_3,"I don't know, but it seems to be some kind of prophetic scenario here, and I seem to be able to see the future here."
Dialog_Action_800641101_4,"No, that shouldn't be the case, those small tests may be able to see the beginning."
Dialog_Action_800641105_1,"Previously seen are the low-level demons that have appeared on the earth, but those who have been transformed have seen for the first time, is the future of the earth to be occupied?"
Dialog_Action_800641105_2,"Just such a weak temptation has made you shake, you are really weak."
Dialog_Action_800641105_3,Are you the Creator? You seem very familiar. Are we connected?
Dialog_Action_800641105_4,"Weak race, you deserve it! Let me show you a different kind of hell!"
Dialog_Action_800641105_5,"The more you show and the more I get, it's just a glimpse into the future, not reality."
Dialog_Action_800641108_1,"Surprisingly, surprisingly, humans have such beliefs, oh what secrets you have."
Dialog_Action_800641108_2,"The mystery of the Creator, the spread of the powers of hell, these are all ruins for mankind, and in your opinion, mankind is never worth mentioning."
Dialog_Action_800641108_3,What do ants say about freedom? What's not worth talking about?
Dialog_Action_800641108_4,That is the meaning of my existence.
Dialog_Action_800641301_1,Why is there such a powerful hell?
Dialog_Action_800641301_2,Something's wrong! This prophecy is wrong!
Dialog_Action_800641301_3,Perhaps that is the meaning of this dream! Maybe I can harness that power!
Dialog_Action_800641505_1,The hell energy here is horrible! A mighty infernal creature!
Dialog_Action_800641505_2,"This is not what I created, this is the future! How could such a terrible hellish creature could have appeared in the Urdak?!"
Dialog_Action_800641505_3,What good research material! Thanks to the Creator!
Dialog_Action_800642101_1,"The unknown is always the source of terror, let me cover your eyes and force your senses!"
Dialog_Action_800642101_2,"But...I have uploaded my consciousness into this mechanical body. Although you have blocked my perception, you cannot completely close it!"
Dialog_Action_800642101_3,Then let me see the technology you're proud of.
Dialog_Action_800642108_1,How can you make such a good decision in the darkness?
Dialog_Action_800642108_2,"As creators, you will always be bright."
Dialog_Action_800642108_3,Is this praising God?
Dialog_Action_800642108_4,"Of course, but because you are so dazzling, the loss of light is dark to you."
Dialog_Action_800642108_5,"However, because of the darkness, even a little light will be dazzling! Incredibly dazzling!"
Dialog_Action_800643101_1,"If you dare to challenge the majesty of the Creator, I will deprive you of the oxygen on which you humans depend, even if you are a robot!"
Dialog_Action_800643101_2,"Humanity is fragile, but it is also incredibly strong, and we will still create hope of birth even in difficult situations!"
Dialog_Action_800643101_3,Arrogant! I will wait for you at the end of this prophecy!
Dialog_Action_800643108_1,"It is hard to imagine that this is not the will of mankind, that this is not the power that mankind should have, and I feel the power of familiarity."
Dialog_Action_800643108_2,"I said it at the beginning, you give me a familiar feeling, you will only deny it arrogantly!"
Dialog_Action_800643108_3,"How can I have a familiar feeling with a human, no, you are not human, it is you, Father."
Dialog_Action_800643108_4,What were you saying?
Dialog_Action_800643108_5,"It doesn't matter, this prophecy is so, go through this last prophecy, go back early to prepare for the coming disaster."
Dialog_Action_990700431_1,"James, can our plan really work?"
Dialog_Action_990700431_2,"Li, what we are doing may not succeed, but it will never fail as long as you are willing to believe."
Dialog_Action_990700431_3,"I, fear that we may be targeted by certain forces, and if so, we…"
Dialog_Action_990700431_4,"Don't think so much, follow me, let's clean up here first, can't live up to the help of old friends."
Dialog_Action_990700432_1,"No, we can't. Super mutants are not something we can compete with. Why are they targeting us?"
Dialog_Action_990700432_2,"Li! If you can hear me, hold on, I've got the Brotherhood out with the beasts! There are not many animals left! You must escape!"
Dialog_Action_990700432_3,"James is still alive, then I can't die, can't die until the ideal is realized!"
Dialog_Action_990700433_1,"The waterway here is the last key left by James before he leaves, so be sure to protect it."
Dialog_Action_990700433_2,"Lee, this waterway is one of the important conduits for delivering clean water to the capital. This is a favorite place for aquatic life. Please come and visit regularly."
Dialog_Action_990700433_3,"James, I'm here. Where are you?"
Dialog_Action_990700434_1,"Madison! Our vanguard has sacrificed for your cause! And you, or you, haven't given us hope yet!"
Dialog_Action_990700434_2,"Sarah, I...I don't know, I've been betrayed, I don't know how to continue, I…I'm sorry."
Dialog_Action_990700434_3,"No, I'm sorry, Li, I've worked hard for you all these years, and I'm here to get you out of here."
Dialog_Action_990700434_4,James?!?!?
Dialog_Action_990700434_5,"James, you're still alive!?!?!? Where have you been all these years! I know her death has had a big impact on you, but what about our cause! And our ideals!"
Dialog_Action_990700434_6,"Li, I know you're disappointed, but I'll explain it to you when we're out of bed."
Dialog_Action_990700435_1,"This group of bastard rulers, scientists like you who are benefiting the entire wasteland should be exterminated quickly!"
Dialog_Action_990700435_2,"It's normal, they won't allow anyone to escape from their control, let alone the entire wasteland of the capital."
Dialog_Action_990700435_3,"James, what do we do now?"
Dialog_Action_990700435_4,"If they are going kill us, then we must not sit idly by!"
Dialog_Action_800641103_1,What a weapon... such a power.... looks fantastic!
Dialog_Action_800641103_2,"The product of the power of hell, with it, maybe it can be used to deal with those high-level demons, otherwise it will be difficult to shake the high-level demons with your current power."
Dialog_Action_800641103_3,"In other words, to seize the opportunity, you need to use such a weapon to break the situation. I will use this power well."
Dialog_Action_990700451_1,"Cargill, I'm Cargill, and Cargill has a head like a leopard, and a tail like a leopard, so why is Cargill so different from those Red Guards?"
Dialog_Action_990700451_2,"In addition, there will be other forms of life in the outside world."
Dialog_Action_990700451_3,"Wait, what's that in front of you? How can there be such a small and ugly creature! Stand still!"
Dialog_Action_990700452_1,The Cargill ahead! Stop! Don't go any further! It's dangerous ahead!
Dialog_Action_990700452_2,"Don't stop Cargill, Sasha sees a creature she hasn't seen before! Three Eyes!"
Dialog_Action_990700452_3,Aren't you looking for death? Such a stupid Cargill! Doesn't that mean Cargill is smart?
Dialog_Action_990700452_4,"Big monkey, don't run!"
Dialog_Action_990700452_5,"That's not a big monkey, there are trolls in this cave!"
Dialog_Action_990700453_1,"Cargill thinks the world is amazing, and there are a lot of things Cargill doesn't know."
Dialog_Action_990700453_2,"You have studied enough creatures, almost enough, and with your temper, if I don't follow you, you won't see the sun tomorrow."
Dialog_Action_990700453_3,"Hey, you said, since meat lumps can produce creatures, then do you think magic will produce any creatures?"
Dialog_Action_990700453_4,"Shut your cat mouth, there are magical creatures in front of you, be careful."
Dialog_Action_990700454_1,"Hey, dragon slayer, don't you think the creatures we killed before will have an energy emanating from their bodies when they die?"
Dialog_Action_990700454_2,"That's called a soul, do you know that there is still a hell in this world? The souls of the good ones go to heaven, the bad ones go to hell and then become annihilated."
Dialog_Action_990700454_3,Annihilation? What's that?
Dialog_Action_990700454_4,"That is the source of chaos in this world, the root of all evil, to be eliminated!"
Dialog_Action_990700454_5,That's awesome! Cargill hasn't seen it yet. Is it here?
Dialog_Action_990700454_6,"If you encounter annihilation, it's just the two of us, and they turn into ashes when they blow it, but there is a wave of soul here."
Dialog_Action_990700454_7,Whoa! Great! Cargill must see you!
Dialog_Action_990700455_1,"You've come to see why there is such a complete building underground, although it seems to be very old, it still looks very complete."
Dialog_Action_990700455_2,"It doesn't look simple, there's no war, there's no destruction, it's like being wiped out in an instant."
Dialog_Action_990700455_3,"This is incredible, there must be a huge secret here that may change the world!"
Dialog_Action_990700455_4,"I feel something, maybe we shouldn't go on."
Dialog_Action_990700455_5,"Go, you go, Cargill must explore!"
Dialog_Action_990700455_6,"They have accompanied you for so long, to the end, here also has the breath of the dragon, but also our Blades Hero's responsibility."
Dialog_Action_990700441_1,"This hateful world, I must find my own footing! I want to be king! I want my own power!"
Dialog_Action_990700441_2,"I heard that there is a paradise beyond this wasteland, and there must be a clue how to get there."
Dialog_Action_990700441_3,"The Nuka World raiders are recruiting, and the days of indulgence are beckoning to you!"
Dialog_Action_990700441_4,"I needed to start with a big soldier, but it was just a few more battles for me."
Dialog_Action_990700445_1,"Overboss ColterHold on, your ambition is too big."
Dialog_Action_990700445_2,"Why?! Why?! Why?!I helped you integrate the power of all paradise, and you act like this?!?!"
Dialog_Action_990700445_3,"Are you really working so hard for me? I didn't even know I existed until now, you're just doing it for yourself!"
Dialog_Action_990700445_4,"Kurt, Kurt! You have today too! Hahahahaha! Go to hell!"
Dialog_Action_990700445_6,"A bunch of scum without faith, you dare to question me!"
Dialog_Action_990700445_7,"Low-level creatures with only flesh, how can a creature like you have such power, you are a blasphemy against technology."
Dialog_Action_990700445_8,"A bunch of rubbish, a bunch of rubbish!A group of turtles huddled in the garbage of their predecessors!"
Dialog_Action_990700445_9,You! This monster! The Beast God will not accept you! Your existence is a blasphemy against the Beast God!
Dialog_Action_990700445_10,"Hahahahahahaha, a group of rats is also worthy of beasts, rats in the wilderness!"
Dialog_Action_801004012_1,Hey guys we are finally at the last location of this adventure!
Dialog_Action_801004012_2,"Yeah, we can finally talk."
Dialog_Action_801004012_3,"Alas, if you don't tell me, I haven't noticed yet, we didn't talk before this adventure!"
Dialog_Action_801004012_4,Why is this? How about we go down first and see if we can find any reason.
Dialog_Action_801004012_5,reindeer! ! I can finally call the reindeer!
Dialog_Action_801004012_6,"what? Drinking Cherry Coke has ruined your brain, do you think you should answer you if you call reindeer reindeer? Drink your Cherry Coke and go!"
Dialog_Action_801004012_7,I... you! ! ! Is that why you good-looking reindeer kept hitting us but ignoring us?
Dialog_Action_801004012_8,"I don't know, the secret must not be leaked, bye bye."
Dialog_Action_801004012_9,"Damn, catch up with her! I must ask clearly! How did she know we drank so many Cherry Cokes?"
Dialog_Action_801004012_10,"It's them, it's them! They chased me all the way! I'm not a sheep, why are you chasing me? Can you still boil me?"
Dialog_Action_801004012_11,"It's you! It's you! Last year you laughed at the hat Jessica gave me, this year! You are still here this year!"
Dialog_Action_801004012_12,"Yo, Dave, you've come to your senses, we've met several times this year, why did you ignore us before?"
Dialog_Action_801004012_13,do not ask me! I don't know either! If I knew that I would have scolded you to death long ago! A bunch of heretics messing with Christmas! A group of robbers who only know how to drink anti-radiation and Cherry Coke!
Dialog_Action_801004012_14,"Tsk, since you said so, we are not welcome, hand over the bell!"
Dialog_Action_801004012_15,Meet again friends! It's an honor to see you again Marowski!
Dialog_Action_801004012_16,We've seen it before! Hey!
Dialog_Action_801004012_17,Is it like this? Then Marowski is here~!
Dialog_Action_801004012_18,This elevator is too long! Is it someone who specially made things difficult for us! ?
Dialog_Action_801004012_19,"Don't think so much, we can't be manipulated by someone, especially the one through the screen."
Dialog_Action_801004012_20,What do you think the teleportation machines in this column are for?
Dialog_Action_801004012_21,"Maybe just for fun? But since we're here, wouldn't it be unworthy of our status as scavengers if we don't search all of them."
Dialog_Action_801004012_22,Roar! ! ! !
Dialog_Action_801004012_23,"Ah, you have pissed off the beast! What did you do to him before?"
Dialog_Action_801004012_24,Does this... steal its bell?
Dialog_Action_801004012_25,"Hey, then you are finished, accept its wrath!"
Dialog_Action_801004012_26,"The front seems to be the end. If there is anything we haven't finished, we can look back now, especially those teleportation machines."
Dialog_Action_801004012_27,"After going around for a long time, I entered a dead end again!"
Dialog_Action_801004012_28,"Wait, there seems to be a strange record stored on the terminal here."
Dialog_Action_801004012_29,What does it talk about? Tell me quickly.
Dialog_Action_801004012_30,"It seems to be a passage, don't be afraid for fear, don't fall into the abyss of another world, don't imagine the horror of the outside world."
Dialog_Action_801004012_31,"That is to say, those familiar strange images that we encounter and see are all existences from the past or the future or not in this world that we imagined, but we have not faced them correctly?"
Dialog_Action_801004012_32,And the time we are in now is Christmas. Is this the revelation sent to us by the Heavenly Father?
Dialog_Action_801004012_33,Maybe the eleven adventures I spent in silence before were all a test and a temptation.
Dialog_Action_801004012_34,"I think maybe we don't have to think so much, as long as we are still there is the best result."
Dialog_Action_801004012_35,"Well, you're right, the Vault needs us, and so does the wasteland."
Dialog_Action_801004012_36,"Alas, thanks to friends from past today and future present for sending us help, maybe these bells in our hands are the answer."
Dialog_Action_990700436_1,"My friend, or hello, do you really think I look so strange? Are they still my kind?"
Dialog_Action_990700436_2,(Watching cockroaches mimic the sound of cockroaches) Squeak?
Dialog_Action_990700436_3,"Alas, it seems that you still can't understand me, but it's okay, there should be a lot of your kind here, right?"
Dialog_Action_990700436_4,(Watching cockroaches mimic the sound of cockroaches) Squeak squeak.
Dialog_Action_990700436_5,"Looks like you're excited, so let's go!"
Dialog_Action_990700436_6,"Yo, buddy, there you are! Come out quickly, don't be afraid, we are partners, we are all detested by people, so don't hate each other anymore!"
Dialog_Action_990700436_7,Our partner is stuck with this big guy! Get rid of it and get our friends!
Dialog_Action_990700436_8,"We have friends here too! Okay, okay, okay! Our team is growing again!"
Dialog_Action_990700438_1,"Hahahahaha, you will not let me go! Don't let me go! Since you won't let me go, I'll kill you in your house! Cleaned up! You! Get ready for combat! I'm right, buddy!"
Dialog_Action_990700438_2,(Watching cockroaches mimic the sound of cockroaches) Squeak!
Dialog_Action_990700438_3,"Hahahahaha, it looks like we're finally communicating! You think I'm right too! Then we'll go in!"
Dialog_Action_990700438_4,What the hell! A madman and a pack of cockroaches! Disgusting! Monsters! Failure of radiation mutation!
Dialog_Action_990700438_5,(Sound breaking) Dead!!!!
Dialog_Action_990700440_1,My people have taken it! Tortured to death! I want them back! They are my people and I am their king!
Dialog_Action_990700440_2,"Hey! This maniac, this maniac is still here! I just caught a few of his cockroaches playing a trampling game! Look at him! He's in a hurry. He's in a hurry!"
Dialog_Action_990700440_3,You have to die! We all have to die! You brutally murdered the Roachking's people! You will be destroyed by cockroaches! Cockroach crushing!!!
Dialog_Action_990700440_4,"My people, you are alive! Great! Come on, follow me!"
Dialog_Action_990700440_5,"My God, there is still a living cockroach here, and this garbage will be eaten by more cockroaches. I am excited to think about it!"
Dialog_Action_990700440_6,"Hahahahaha, very nice garbage heap! Perfect for our retreat! Great! That's it! My Roachking is unbeatable!"
Dialog_Action_990700476_1,"Where am I, who am I, where am I?What a concept...Me?What is it?"
Dialog_Action_990700476_2,"(Maybe there is something that can answer this question, and what is this state now, so chaotic, so irritable)"
Dialog_Action_990700476_3,"(What kind of breath is in the front room, so uncomfortable, but that's okay, maybe the owner of the breath can give me some answers)"
Dialog_Action_990700476_4,"What!What is it? What is it? A Deathclaw! No, no, no, no. Why is he still wearing armor? No, no, no, I must be dreaming, it's fake, it's all fake! Kill the monster!"
Dialog_Action_990700476_5,"(Strong smell of fear, I am a monster, but also yes, they look different from me, kill, I can understand the meaning of the word, very clear understanding)"
Dialog_Action_990700476_6,"(Fear, killing, blood, death...)It all seems so sweet to me, is it my instinct or say I'm a monster, but what's wrong, where to tell me that I shouldn't be)"
Dialog_Action_990700477_1,"Am I fake? What does false mean, shouldn't it exist, then what am I really?)"
Dialog_Action_990700477_2,"(No, be sure to find your own meaning, there seems to be something in the underworld to tell me that if I can't rationalize my existence, I will disappear)"
Dialog_Action_990700477_3,"(What is it? It seems to be a place that can be unblocked, this thing should be called a key? There seems to be more than one here.)"
Dialog_Action_990700477_4,"(It feels so uncomfortable, it feels like there is something here that feels the same as the armor sheet on your body)"
Dialog_Action_990700477_5,"(The feeling of being close by blood, we are the same, but why is this kind full of hostility and danger!)"
Dialog_Action_990700479_1,"""Ow-wooo""!( I am a monster, I am a monster, roar roar, I am more monstrous than a monster, then I should do something like a monster behavior! Slaughter, fear, blood, maybe that's what I crave."
Dialog_Action_990700479_2,"The experimental subject that escaped was found, and the arrest permission was obtained, and the worst-case killing experiment problem permission was obtained."
Dialog_Action_990700479_3,"(No blood, no flesh, no soul, these are not creatures, and there is no sense of fear! It makes me irritable, very irritable! Kill them!)"
Dialog_Action_990700480_1,"Why did you faint again? Were you injured by those strange humanoid weapons before? Wait, can I make a sound!?"
Dialog_Action_990700480_2,"It doesn't feel right, there is an aura around me that makes me close, I want to find it, it seems that if I find it, I can find the answer to what I am!"
Dialog_Action_990700480_3,"Child, the danger ahead, let me face it with you."
Dialog_Action_990700480_4,"I feel like I know you, who are you?"
Dialog_Action_990700480_5,"I created you, maybe I shouldn't say that, it was the imagination of many people in the wasteland who created you, and I'm just the one who made you come true."
Dialog_Action_990700480_6,Can I trust you?
Dialog_Action_990700480_7,"For me to create you naturally because you have value, of course, you also have the value of your own existence, by the way, forget to tell you, your name is [Steelclaw]."
Dialog_Action_990700480_8,"If that's the case, then let's tear the problem apart, using the claws of steel!"
Dialog_Action_990700480_9,"There are many ways to solve the problem, of course, the previous problem can be solved by tearing."
Dialog_Action_990700480_10,"Hello, weird big guy."
Dialog_Action_990700480_11,(gnashing of teeth) You! I want it! What are you doing?
Dialog_Action_990700480_12,"Relax, big guy. If Shaun's staying with you that means that he created you. If so, I'll help you."
Dialog_Action_990700480_13,"Help? What can I do for you? Do you want to help me get my teeth cleaned, or do you want to help me bait my prey?"
Dialog_Action_990700480_14,"Big guy, your temper is really bad, then I will help you adjust your temper, do you mind if I walk with you?"
Dialog_Action_990700480_15,"Nate, Sean, you two stay with this…This...It must be Deathclaws. What are you doing?"
Dialog_Action_990700480_16,"I am not the Deathclaw, the Deathclaw treats me as an enemy!"
Dialog_Action_990700480_17,"Oh, my God!Who taught you the commonwealth dialect with perfect pronunciation?"
Dialog_Action_990700480_18,"When I wake up, who are you? Are you here to arrest me?"
Dialog_Action_990700480_19,"I didn't come to catch you, but it should be you. Some time ago, there was a rumor in Diamond City that a legendary mechanically enhanced large death claw appeared in the wasteland. I thought it was very interesting, so I came to investigate. It seems that it is yours."
Dialog_Action_990700480_20,"So you found me now, what do you want?"
Dialog_Action_990700480_21,"Of course, I fought with you, watching you fight is a good experience? If you want to make a friend, it is rare to make a good friend in this wasteland!"
Dialog_Action_990700480_22,"Strange people, obviously you are the same as those who have no blood, no meat, and no biological machine toys, but you seem to have a good soul, at least it tastes good."
Dialog_Action_990700480_23,Thank you for your praise. How about we first get rid of the bad taste from the previous one?
Dialog_Action_990700480_24,"I'm glad you think the same way, my friend."
Dialog_Action_800651101_1,"Oh, I didn't expect to open the envelope and come here."
Dialog_Action_800651101_2,"Yeah, I didn't expect that."
Dialog_Action_800651101_3,"Yo, Barbarian, you're silent today. It doesn't fit your personality! Shouldn't you jump in excitement?"
Dialog_Action_800651101_4,"Uh, yeah."
Dialog_Action_800651101_5,Something's not right.
Dialog_Action_800651101_6,"Okay, ladies and gentlemen, don't think about it so much, he may have food poisoning, go ahead."
Dialog_Action_800651101_7,"Take a break, I'll take the lead."
Dialog_Action_800651102_1,"Disgusting rat, damn it."
Dialog_Action_800651102_2,"Yeah, yeah, damn it, yeah!"
Dialog_Action_800651102_3,"You're dead, don't come out again!"
Dialog_Action_800651102_4,"Yeah, I'm dead, you just have to believe that and don't mind me."
Dialog_Action_800651102_5,Today's barbarians look wrong.
Dialog_Action_800651103_1,"Heh, there are mole rats here, and it seems that there are quite a few of them, oh, they are simply the scourge of the forest!"
Dialog_Action_800651103_2,Is there such a strange mole in this forest?
Dialog_Action_800651103_3,It shouldn't have been there the last time I was here.
Dialog_Action_800651103_4,"It's a bit interesting, it seems that some power was deliberately arranged it for us."
Dialog_Action_800651103_5,"It was a little funny, especially that the Barbarian didn't seem to think anything was wrong."
Dialog_Action_800651103_6,"Funny, funny."
Dialog_Action_800651104_1,Grognak! Why did you come here without saying a word?
Dialog_Action_800651104_2,"Chasing things, white ones!"
Dialog_Action_800651104_3,What's so funny?
Dialog_Action_800651104_4,"Follow it and see, it came out of the previous hole, there should be something hidden."
Dialog_Action_800651106_1,The breath in this cave gives a very uncomfortable feeling.
Dialog_Action_800651106_2,"Well, that's right, toxic."
Dialog_Action_800651106_3,"Did it exist in the forest? And, can you say a few more words, you're getting weird!"
Dialog_Action_800651106_4,"Unlike the previous gas, be careful!"
Dialog_Action_800651106_5,"This anomaly must be caused by something, and perhaps this is also a clue."
Dialog_Action_800651108_1,It's like an old friend's cave.
Dialog_Action_800651108_2,Are you sure? But there was something wrong with the atmosphere.
Dialog_Action_800651108_3,"Well, it didn't actually come out to greet me."
Dialog_Action_800651108_4,You haven't yet determined if this is your old friend's lair.
Dialog_Action_800651108_5,"No, I already smell it."
Dialog_Action_800651108_6,"You see, my old friend is there, and he looks quite enthusiastic."
Dialog_Action_800651108_7,You call that passion! Prepare for battle!
Dialog_Action_800651108_8,"Ancient sorrow, you know, we had to do that."
Dialog_Action_800651108_9,"It's okay, it's not what it is anymore, it's a good thing."
Dialog_Action_800651108_10,(whispers) He's not crazy. Something's wrong!
Dialog_Action_800651108_11,"Feeling irritable? Crazy? Don't be depressed anymore. Look, your old friend's eyes are still looking at you, don't you want to avenge it?"
Dialog_Action_800651108_12,Shut up!
Dialog_Action_800651108_13,Did I mess with you? What am I doing?
Dialog_Action_800651108_14,Not to you.
Dialog_Action_800651108_15,"This should be the end of the region. It doesn't seem too dangerous here, so how about we split up next?"
Dialog_Action_800652101_1,Blood and rotten smells attracted the scavenger flies.
Dialog_Action_800652101_2,What does it mean to be able to say such a profound thing?
Dialog_Action_800652101_3,"No, I mean literally."
Dialog_Action_800652101_4,"I hope everyone else is okay, but I always feel that there is no surprise that our story is meaningless."
Dialog_Action_800652103_1,Rotten and bloody smells grow heavier and heavier.
Dialog_Action_800652103_2,"Yes, it means that more and more things are buried under this land."
Dialog_Action_800652103_3,Do you know what's buried down here?
Dialog_Action_800652103_4,It may be called God's grave.
Dialog_Action_800652103_5,"Keep exploring, the mosquito's corpse will tell us some stories."
Dialog_Action_800652104_1,"It was the smell of Shannon, and the girl had come here."
Dialog_Action_800652104_2,Is your nose better than mine?
Dialog_Action_800652104_3,"The smell of it, of course, I'll never forget."
Dialog_Action_800652104_4,You're hiding pretty deep. Are you hurt?
Dialog_Action_800652104_5,"Is it a mental injury? The area is full of disgusting smells, and those fat ugly fly mosquitoes."
Dialog_Action_800652104_6,"Put aside your heartache, you should find a lot of interesting things here."
Dialog_Action_800652104_7,"Well, of course, I know you like secrets best."
Dialog_Action_800652104_8,"Since it's a secret, let's not talk about it, let's go find someone else first."
Dialog_Action_990700446_1,"Thank you for your blessing, I will always serve you as your faithful servant, and your will is my mission."
Dialog_Action_990700446_2,(Ancient Voice) QETHSEGOL VahRukIV Vur DO Faal Vahlok Nonvul aar SE Dovah WEN DEZ LOST Wah Qahnaar TahRodiis Miraak
Dialog_Action_990700446_3,"Your enlightenment has opened my eyes, and I will fulfill my duty here!"
Dialog_Action_990700448_1,Why are you betraying our faith?
Dialog_Action_990700448_2,"Why did you say that? Dragon, is it not enough to treat us as servants, and not treat us as people at all?"
Dialog_Action_990700448_3,(Ancient Voice) Nir HET Mah FaaSNu Ronaan UNDveld aaR KRiiD GROHiik ahRK DROG DO LOT nir

Dialog_Action_990700448_6,Your analogy is fitting. I...It will be dealt with.
Dialog_Action_990700450_1,"This is the consequences of placing your trust in it, dragons are ruthless creatures, you and I, are very clear!"
Dialog_Action_990700450_2,"So what can we do? My faith may be blind, but what about yours? If it wasn't for your loneliness and anger against the dragon, it would not have turned out this way!"
Dialog_Action_990700450_3,"You and I are of one mind. How do you think I came here? It is not ""I"" who insists on going my own way, but yourself."
Dialog_Action_990700450_4,"Then the only way now is to say, the only way we can escape the curse is to put the dragon to sleep, let us sleep, right?"
Dialog_Action_990700450_5,"You figured it out yourself, didn't you? Why bother to ask me again, execute it, go face the dragon, face the mistakes you and I have made, and seek a future for the subjects."
Dialog_Action_990700482_1,"Lucas, you have to remember that in the era of prosperity, cowboys were a kind of spiritual symbol."
Dialog_Action_990700482_2,"Father, what kind of spiritual symbol is that?"
Dialog_Action_990700482_3,"It is brave, it is freedom, it is hard work, and it is a symbol of absolute justice. You have to remember, you have to be like this person."
Dialog_Action_990700482_4,"Well, just like in those videos, be brave and stand up for justice!"
Dialog_Action_990700483_1,"Hey boss, this is a great place!"
Dialog_Action_990700483_2,"Yes, not far from Megaton Town! We can observe them, then loot them!"
Dialog_Action_990700483_3,Their idiot sheriff would never have guessed that we were hiding right under their noses!
Dialog_Action_990700483_4,"We are not hiding! We are entrenched here aboveboard, do you know what is entrenched! Just tell them we're here!"
Dialog_Action_990700483_5,"Yes, we are many! Boss! We have a lot of people! The mayor is the only one who can fight there! He's the only one hahahahaha!"
Dialog_Action_990700483_6,"Of course, even if he appears in front of us now, we are not afraid!"
Dialog_Action_990700483_7,"Well, I'm right here, who were you acting for just now?"
Dialog_Action_990700483_8,Boss! Where is he!
Dialog_Action_990700483_9,I know! So aren't we talking to you that we have a lot of people!
Dialog_Action_990700483_10,But it didn't scare him!
Dialog_Action_990700483_11,What else can I do! Hit him!
Dialog_Action_990700483_12,"My God, what kind of people are these people!"
Dialog_Action_990700485_1,"Colin, I didn't expect, I didn't expect, you are so inappropriate!"
Dialog_Action_990700485_2,Something I can't get! Don't even think about it! anyone!
Dialog_Action_990700485_3,Don't you know that you were taken as a gun? You idiot!
Dialog_Action_990700485_4,"Of course I know, as long as I blow up there, I won't be a mere town mayor anymore! My boss will give me more money!"
Dialog_Action_990700485_5,"You really think you are a scavenger, oh, maybe you don’t count, at least you don’t think you are a scavenger, you are such a useless person, why does your boss take a fancy to you?"
Dialog_Action_990700485_6,"I? I am a person with great ability! Mr. Burke appreciates me, and Mr. Burke promised me that if I blow up there, he'll introduce me to his boss, a real big shot!"
Dialog_Action_990700485_7,"No, you won't see the big man. I promise!"
Dialog_Action_990700485_8,"Oh~ That's not necessarily my friend, I'll give you a piece of advice, next time you come back here, don't come looking for me."
Dialog_Action_990700481_1,"According to the clues of the victims, the group of cannibals are hiding here?"
Dialog_Action_990700481_2,"Sheriff? What are you a megaton town dog doing here? Dogs take mice, mind your own business!"
Dialog_Action_990700481_3,"I don't mind being a dog, but...you are not as good as rats in this wasteland!"
Dialog_Action_990700481_4,"Bastard, shoot! fuck him!"
Dialog_Action_990700481_5,"Alas, mice still know how to assess the situation, but you are really not as good as mice!"
Dialog_Action_800652105_1,"(Laughter) Now that you've found me, how does the deep sea feel?"
Dialog_Action_800652105_2,"Silly fish, you have no idea why there is a deep sea feeling in a forest?"
Dialog_Action_800652105_3,"It doesn't affect me anyway, but it doesn't necessarily affect you."
Dialog_Action_800652105_4,"Thanks for the reminder, I'll get out of here with you as soon as possible."
Dialog_Action_800652105_5,Do you need me to get you some oxygen?
Dialog_Action_800652105_6,"No, I'm afraid I'll rip your gills off."
Dialog_Action_800652105_7,"The detective also said that you are not the same, as far as I am concerned, you are still so barbaric."
Dialog_Action_800652107_1,How did you get down there with all those disgusting legless beasts?
Dialog_Action_800652107_2,"Detectives naturally have a detective-like approach, by the way, there are some interesting clues. Do you want to know?"
Dialog_Action_800652107_3,I don't want to know since it wont affect me.
Dialog_Action_800652107_4,"Something is wrong, it seems you already know something."
Dialog_Action_800652107_5,It doesn't matter. How long are you staying in this disgusting place?
Dialog_Action_800652107_6,"Oh, okay, we're leaving now."
Dialog_Action_800652108_1,"Long time no see, my friend."
Dialog_Action_800652108_2,"No, we weren't friends, we weren't friends."
Dialog_Action_800652108_3,"Yeah, a worm. Did you climb on any of the masters?"
Dialog_Action_800652108_4,"Alright, since that's the case, let's clean it up, I hope its body can be as hard as its mouth, then it can be useful!"
Dialog_Action_800661101_1,Is this hell? Can this really save me?
Dialog_Action_800661101_2,"However, is this the welcome ceremony of hell?"
Dialog_Action_800661102_1,Is this a soldier from hell? Also polluted by hell?
Dialog_Action_800661102_2,"Of course I won't, I am different from this group of worthless chief soldiers! Harnessing the powers of hell is only part of the research."
Dialog_Action_800661103_1,Disgusting smell! Very disgusting! But it seems that this power will make the demon's power even stronger!
Dialog_Action_800661103_2,"It is a nest of blood, a special product of hell."
Dialog_Action_800661103_3,Who are you!
Dialog_Action_800661103_4,"Olivia Pierce, Samir Hayden's student, you can ask my teacher for proof."
Dialog_Action_800661103_5,How sure are you that we know your teacher.
Dialog_Action_800661103_6,"Don't pretend, you can't get here without the help of my teacher."
Dialog_Action_800661103_7,But your teacher doesn't think very well of you.
Dialog_Action_800661103_8,"Are these important? Go on with your journey, (whispers) Don't waste me opening the door to this new world."
Dialog_Action_800661104_1,"I always feel like I'm being watched, is it an illusion?"
Dialog_Action_800661104_2,"You are on the brink of hell, what do you think is watching you?"
Dialog_Action_800661104_3,"Sure enough, the eyes of hell are really floating everywhere. Do you think if we knock out these eyes, will there be something that will feel pain?"
Dialog_Action_800661104_4,Do you suffer from the death of an insignificant cell? (whispers) Foolish humans!
Dialog_Action_800661108_1,"It's too late for you, mortals. The portal is now provided with Yajin energy directly from hell."
Dialog_Action_800661108_2,"My brothers will continue to come to your world through portals, and not even Doom can save you!"
Dialog_Action_800661108_3,Accept your fate!
Dialog_Action_800661108_4,"The demon was right, the energy of the portal to hell cannot be closed on this side."
Dialog_Action_800661108_5,Only in hell can the portal be completely closed and this invasion stopped.
Dialog_Action_800661108_6,(Doom Slayer snorts)
Dialog_Action_800661108_7,"Look, here he is! Doom will fix everything."
Dialog_Action_800661108_8,"(whispers) After that it's easy, taking out Doom solves everything."
Dialog_Action_800662101_1,"Is this the passage to hell? Shouldn't it be a beam of light, send it on?"
Dialog_Action_800662101_2,Who can prove that this is a real space? Maybe this is just the danger you will face when you enter hell.
Dialog_Action_800662101_3,Just the ones across the bridge? Is this a little too easy?
Dialog_Action_800662101_4,"Of course it is for you (in a low voice) If it is very difficult at the beginning, how can you lure people in and kill them?"
Dialog_Action_800662104_1,"It's too dark here, am I blind?"
Dialog_Action_800662104_2,"We are still in a nightmare, this is a normal situation, deprivation of vision, this is the simplest method."
Dialog_Action_800662104_3,Isn't it like being trapped in a nightmare wall? It was torture!
Dialog_Action_800662104_4,Listen to yourself what are you talking about? This is hell!
Dialog_Action_800662104_5,"Hmph, that's why the passage was destroyed!"
Dialog_Action_800662104_6,"No, I take back what I said earlier, maybe the real hell is up there."
Dialog_Action_800662108_1,"Another portal to hell, this place should not be in a nightmare."
Dialog_Action_800662108_2,"Hahahaha, my friends, you are still as confident as ever, go ahead and see, there will be surprises waiting for you."
Dialog_Action_800662108_3,"We meet again, you really linger!"
Dialog_Action_800662108_4,"Sorry, we really don't want to see you!"
Dialog_Action_800663103_1,"It's too quiet here, but it doesn't feel so empty."
Dialog_Action_800663103_2,"Of course, you have no secrets in hell, so here is also full of order."
Dialog_Action_800663103_3,So this is where we're being watched? Solving the guards here should help us in our future actions!
Dialog_Action_800663103_4,Then you guys give it a try!
Dialog_Action_800663108_1,"Doom, what a stupid name, it's time to end this feud!"
Dialog_Action_800663108_2,(The Doom Slayer silently changed the magazine of the shotgun in his hand)
Dialog_Action_800663108_3,"It seems that someone is coming, why don't we deal with the uninvited guest before continuing our topic?"
Dialog_Action_800663108_4,(The Doom Slayer nodded silently)
Dialog_Action_800663108_5,do not! You hit yours first! We are not involved!
Dialog_Action_800663108_6,"Stupid human being, do you still trust that inhuman guy beside you?"
Dialog_Action_800663108_7,"It's your fate that you are still alive, she has been leading you into the pit, don't you know?"
Dialog_Action_800663108_8,"Do you also believe in the words of the devil? The Doom Warrior itself is also a creation with demon power. If you want to close the passage to hell, the two standing in front of you must get rid of them!"
Dialog_Action_800663108_9,"(At this time, the Doom Slayer nodded and raised the gun in his hand)"
Dialog_Action_800663108_10,"(Smiling knowingly) So that's how it is, and that's exactly what I want!"
Dialog_Action_800663108_11,"(Predator laughs like an old exhaust fan) Come on, what a feeling to join forces with a hypocritical idol!"
Dialog_Action_990700456_1,"Elder Owen, this city is full of predators, they have lost their humanity, what shall we do?"
Dialog_Action_990700456_2,"I know it's difficult, but we can't give up. We are the Brotherhood of Steel, and our duty is to defend the people."
Dialog_Action_990700456_3,"But our troops are only one hundred people, and these looters are bandits with rich combat experience."
Dialog_Action_990700456_4,"Then we must make a realistic plan and execute it with confidence. Using our advanced weaponry, we can create defensive lines around cities to distract the enemy before we take action."
Dialog_Action_990700456_5,"good idea! We can also set up bait on the position to lure the enemy to the right place, so that we can easily eliminate them."
Dialog_Action_990700456_6,"Yes, we must seize every opportunity. But remember, we are fighters but we shouldn't lose our humanity. We need to abide by laws and moral principles and respect all life, even the life of our enemies."
Dialog_Action_990700456_7,"Understood, Elder Owen! You have always been our role model and I will strictly follow your instructions."
Dialog_Action_990700456_8,"Great, let's move forward! For the people, for justice!"
Dialog_Action_990700458_1,"These looters are so unruly, what they have done has exceeded the limits of our tolerance, and we must make them pay."
Dialog_Action_990700458_2,"I totally agree with you, Ishmael. But we must also pay attention to the method, we cannot follow the same path as the other party."
Dialog_Action_990700458_3,"I understand your concern, but we must resolutely protect the innocent people and completely eliminate this group of criminals in order to bring this city back to life."
Dialog_Action_990700458_4,"We will do our best to uphold justice and ensure that our actions are in full compliance with the law. Remembering that we are members of the Brotherhood of Steel, our actions must strictly abide by our Code and Creed."
Dialog_Action_990700458_5,I assure you that we will carry out our mission with integrity and with due diligence
Dialog_Action_990700460_1,"Owen, I have something to tell you."
Dialog_Action_990700460_2,"What's up? Ishmael, we should move on now."
Dialog_Action_990700460_3
Dialog_Action_990700460_4,"(frowns) But, if you stay here, you can't get enough support and protection. We must be united to survive in this world."
Dialog_Action_990700460_5,"I know, but I can't let innocent people continue to suffer. If I leave them now, who will take care of them? Owen, I must stay."
Dialog_Action_990700460_6,"(sighs) Well, I understand your decision. However, we must stay connected and support each other. Good luck."
Dialog_Action_990700460_7,"Thank you, Owen. I will do my best to complete my mission, and I will always follow your progress."
Dialog_Action_990700491_1,"(With pain and helplessness in his eyes, he seems to be asking for help, and his body is gradually losing control)"
Dialog_Action_990700491_2,"(beating the railing) Son, son, don't worry, I will help you, you are hope and truth, you will not perish here."
Dialog_Action_990700491_3,"(The chapped mouth seems to be trying hard to open, revealing the broken teeth and green blood seeping through. Although it has lost the rationality that should exist, it still seems to have an instinctive reaction)"
Dialog_Action_990700491_4,Let's escape from here together to shine more light on those in need.
Dialog_Action_990700492_1,"Dry blood filled the throat, making it difficult to make a sound, and moaning in pain has become a luxury"
Dialog_Action_990700492_2,"Tried to remember my own name, but there was nothing in my mind, nothing but blankness."
Dialog_Action_990700492_3,"Confused and confused, a gust of cold wind hit him, and he staggered forward a few steps, trying to find shelter."
Dialog_Action_990700492_4,"Everything around is desolate, and the eyes of other creatures looking at it are full of hostility and fear."
Dialog_Action_990700492_5,"Its breath is spreading, just like the beasts in front of it, they are approaching each other."
Dialog_Action_990700493_1,"His body was gradually warming up, which didn't seem like a good thing, but he had to move on."
Dialog_Action_990700493_2,"Dizziness and muscle pain began to strike, his breathing became short of breath, and a feeling of depression was about to move."
Dialog_Action_990700493_3,"Maybe some people can still be seen now, but he has already started to tremble, and it is difficult to control his body."
Dialog_Action_990700493_4,"But at this time, a group of blind scavengers found him, as if they saw a monster."
Dialog_Action_990700494_1,"The skin has already begun to fall off, and the whole body has become bloody and bloody, and the cracks all over the body emit a penetrating green light."
Dialog_Action_990700494_2,"His teeth began to loosen, and the structure of his throat had completely become unable to make a sound, he could only make a roar like a beast."
Dialog_Action_990700494_3,"Arms and legs gradually spread and became stiff, fingers and toes began to deform, and the spine could no longer stand upright."
Dialog_Action_990700494_4,"In the end, it stopped thinking, and the desire to devour and eat overcame everything. Even in the face of the radiation monsters that had avoided it, it could gnaw on it without hesitation."
Dialog_Action_990700495_1,"The low-pitched roar was as loud as a wild beast, and it attracted the attention of believers who came from afar. When they found it, their eyes became fanatical."
Dialog_Action_990700495_2,"God of the atom, it, it, the radiation value of its body damage is like the god of the atom in person! We want to take it back! Please go back!"
Dialog_Action_990700495_3,"Threat found, must be cleaned up! Such a strong radiation source is a huge threat to the wasteland! clean up!"
Dialog_Action_990700496_1,A bunch of scum from the wasteland? It is indeed a group of suitable experimental materials.
Dialog_Action_990700496_2,"Hahahaha, look, a ""Frankenstein"" has eaten meat again today!"
Dialog_Action_990700496_3,"Meat? Well, it's a good idea, the barbecue is a good idea, then let's use fire to deal with you."
Dialog_Action_990700496_4,"This... here is a forging room, it just fits the design of my new weapon, what a coincidence."
Dialog_Action_990700496_5,"Hey, the chick in the front seems to have a nice airbrush on her body! Grab it quickly! It's been a long time since I cooked ""meat"" properly."
Dialog_Action_990700496_6,"It's really a bunch of rubbish, that's fine, there's no burden in the experiment, let's dedicate ourselves to science!"
Dialog_Action_990700497_1,"Knight, where's your team?"
Dialog_Action_990700497_2,"I met Elder Maxson, my team was scattered by the mutants, and I am the only survivor."
Dialog_Action_990700497_3,"Thank you for your hard work, please act with me next time, this group of mutants will pay the price for hurting our Brotherhood of Steel!"
Dialog_Action_990700497_4,"Yes, what happened to my team members was beyond my imagination, and it was my mistake."
Dialog_Action_990700497_5,"Knights, don't blame yourself too much. Every knight of the fraternity has its own beliefs and persistence. Don't let this matter affect your heart."
Dialog_Action_990700497_6,"Thank you elder for your enlightenment, please help me clean up the mutants here and avenge my brothers!"
Dialog_Action_990700497_7,"(Nods his head, waves his hand forward) Action, start!"
Dialog_Action_990700497_8,"Fleeing... Soldiers... courting death... Ho Ho Ho Ho, delicious!"
Dialog_Action_990700497_9,"Scum, communicating with your race is an insult to our own culture."
Dialog_Action_990700497_10,"Please stand behind me, my ""new toy"" will surprise us!"
Dialog_Action_990700498_1,Ingram! Stay!
Dialog_Action_990700498_2,Who are you. . . Teigen! haven't seen you for a long time! Why are you here?
Dialog_Action_990700498_3,"I received a signal from your missing teammates. Although it was weak, it did appear nearby. I didn't find you on the airship, so I'm waiting for you here."
Dialog_Action_990700498_4,"Thanks for letting me know, I'm here to try my luck, and with your confirmation, I'm more confident to find my teammates!"
Dialog_Action_990700498_5,"Okay, I'm here for your convenience."
Dialog_Action_990700498_6,people! people! The source of the signal is clearly here!
Dialog_Action_990700498_7,"Ingram, calm down! The killing along the way makes your emotions uncontrollable!"
Dialog_Action_990700498_8,"We tried our best to find this room, but why... my teammates are not here!"
Dialog_Action_990700498_9,"Yes, but have you ever thought that this journey is so difficult because it is a trap in itself!"
Dialog_Action_990700498_10,brute! How could they have such brains? This group of creatures with well-developed limbs and simple minds should not have this ability!
Dialog_Action_990700498_11,"According to the research of Bachelor Nelia, a small number of special individuals with intelligence no less than ours should have been born in their population. This is very important news, and we need to report to the elders quickly!"
Dialog_Action_990700499_1,"Maxson, there is no need for you to come here, this is just an ordinary scientific research operation."
Dialog_Action_990700499_2,"No, Maester Nelia, you submitted a report on the discovery of suspected superintelligent mutants, which is no small matter."
Dialog_Action_990700499_3,"Grand Elder, please rest assured, with me here, I will guarantee that Bachelor Nelia will be safe."
Dialog_Action_990700499_4,"I'm not worried about your safety, I just want to meet this possible strong opponent, which makes me very excited."
Dialog_Action_990700499_5,"Hey, you tin men, are you the Brotherhood of Steel?"
Dialog_Action_990700499_6,"You know us, no, you actually have clear logic and normal communication skills, it seems that the rumors are true!"
Dialog_Action_990700499_7,"You're the one who doesn't wear iron, it looks like not every fraternity wears iron, and this message needs to get out, so that many little ones don't have to go out with crowbars."
Dialog_Action_990700499_8,"crowbar? You don't mean to pry open the power armor, do you?"
Dialog_Action_990700499_9,"Of course, it's like opening a ""can"", right? Unopened things are really uncommon in the wasteland now."
Dialog_Action_990700499_10,"You are that special mutant! Let's fight! Afterwards it would be great if you could tell me how you were born, a threat like you is best killed in the cradle!"
Dialog_Action_990700499_11,"It turns out that there are also brave people among the two-legged sheep. To defeat me, what you want to know is in the back room!"
Dialog_Action_990700500_1,"Are you awake? What's going on here, I was cleaning the gun on the spaceship, and the siren of the Great Elder went off."
Dialog_Action_990700500_2,Teigen. . . ? you. . . why here? What's wrong with us?
Dialog_Action_990700500_3,been counted.
Dialog_Action_990700500_4,Didn't we fight a super-intelligent mutant before to get key information about how it was born? Why can't I remember what happened next?
Dialog_Action_990700500_5,"Me too, it seems that I passed out, it must be the problem with the key."
Dialog_Action_990700500_6,"Don't worry about these now, we should be surrounded by mutants now, let's find a way to get out first."
Dialog_Action_990700500_7,So I am self-inflicted? Added a meal to the group of offal?
Dialog_Action_990700500_8,Put away your posture and go!
Dialog_Action_990700500_9,"Here is an explorer, use it with caution, don't fall for the trap! Avoid strong enemies as much as possible."
Dialog_Action_990700500_10,"It seems that there is no way to hide, so I can only go up!"
Dialog_Action_990700500_11,"Please do your best, before I fall, I will not let him harm you, I promise!"
Dialog_talk_free1,If I could become Overseer I will...What did I want to say again?
Dialog_talk_free2,What we eat every day is either Synthetic food or canned food. When will we eat real food...
Dialog_talk_free3,I really hope that I won't have to clear sewage disposal facility of the Vault.
Dialog_talk_free4,There was a Super Mutant's thumb in today's soup and it was hard-boiled!
Dialog_talk_work1,There are still many people think that Institute is just made up by adults to scare kids.
Dialog_talk_work2,"I have found many intact comic books on Wasteland, but I've never seen a Bible."
Dialog_talk_work3,"Don't you think since the Bible was written at the behest of the God, who is the creator of the world, that he should at least add one last sentence into it: ""Tell the others the earth is round"" ?"
Dialog_talk_work4,"Do you think there are pandas survived the nuclear war? However even if pandas do survive, they can't live very long because they are so picky about food."
Dialog_talk_work5,The water tastes like metal.
Dialog_talk_work6,I wish that there could be more Mr.Handys to do my work.
Dialog_talk_work7,What we eat every day is Synthetic food or canned food. When can we eat real food...
Dialog_talk_work8,There are still many people think that Institute is just made up by adults to scare kids.
Dialog_talk_work9,All people are saying that this kind of power plant is absolutely safe. But I'm still afraid of being affected by radiation.
Dialog_talk_work10,Our power generating efficiency has reached 100%.
Dialog_talk_work11,It's said that before the great war there was a technology which enables power generating from human body. I saw it from a Documentary called The Matrix.
Dialog_talk_work12,I really wish I could understand the meaning of this red glittering button.
Dialog_talk_work13,I saw someone drinking dirty water one time. He grew a extra limb.
Dialog_talk_work14,"Comparing to the Vaults in the west, our water chips are more durable."
Dialog_talk_work15,I think maybe we can sell some purified water.
Dialog_talk_work16,They say our water is recycled. Does that mean I am drinking water from my bathtub?
Dialog_talk_work17,Why didn't the Overseer consider claiming a piece of farmland outside the Vault?
Dialog_talk_work18,People before the war despised transgenic food. But it's the only clean food now.
Dialog_talk_work19,I only had a little bit and no one will know about it.
Dialog_talk_work20,Not only did the war destroy civilizations. It also destroyed curry.
Dialog_talk_work21,I think the bottle Caps without bottles we make are more or less counterfeit currency.
Dialog_talk_work22,Will the efficiency of our production of Caps lead to inflation of Wasteland?
Dialog_talk_work23,"If we could produce Nuka-Cola while producing bottle Caps, we can earn more money."
Dialog_talk_work24,I saw one time someone put a pair of old boots into the recycling machine.
Dialog_talk_work25,"If we replace all our teammates with robots...Well, the cost is too high."
Dialog_talk_work26,Sometimes I think it's a right decision for the Institute to use Synth to fight.
Dialog_talk_work27,Maybe we can look into how to produce robots which work automatically.
Dialog_talk_work28,Why do we have to fight the intruders in the Vault instead of keeping them out.
Dialog_talk_work29,Our water is recycled. Does that mean that I am drinking water from my bathtub?
Dialog_talk_work30,Why didn't the Overseer consider claiming a piece of farmland outside the Vault?
Dialog_talk_work31,"Do you think there are pandas survived the nuclear war? However even if pandas do survive, they can't live very long because they are so picky about food."
Dialog_talk_work32,I am hungry. Are there any leftovers in the Diner?
Dialog_talk_work33,I can endure any kinds of treatment as long as I don't get amputated.
Dialog_talk_work34,I always try to figure out how Stimpak works. Why is it effective to all kinds of injuries?
Dialog_talk_work35,It's said that some residents of the Wasteland think eating raw Radroaches can protect them from radiation.
Dialog_talk_work36,Please find someone else to be your Doctor next time. I am not used to such gory scenes.
Dialog_talk_work37,I've heard that all Vaults are designed to carry out specific social experiments at first. But only a few people survive.
Dialog_talk_work38,I've heard that someone will go to Diamond City next month. I hope they can bring back cookies with new flavor.
Dialog_talk_work39,"I heard there is a Vault with a male-to-female ratio of 1: 999. I'm so env...No, It's gross!"
Dialog_talk_work40,It's said that some residents of Wasteland think eating raw Radroaches can protect them from radiation.
Dialog_talk_work41,The Diner is out of coffee again. Do you think that someone is stealing it and selling it to the black market secretly?
Dialog_talk_work42,Will the efficiency of our production of Caps lead to inflation of Wasteland?
Dialog_talk_work43,"When I was outside, I had never seen children of Super Mutants."
Dialog_talk_work44,The Diner is out out coffee again. Do you think that someone is stealing it and selling it in the black market secretly?
Dialog_talk_work45,I really can't find a reason to live in this miserable world without the Nuka-Cola machine.
Dialog_talk_work46,"They said that Nuka-Cola was the most popular beverage before the war, which is obviously wrong. It's still the most popular beverage after the war."
Dialog_talk_work47,There's nothing better than drinking a cold Nuka-Cola after a day's hard work.
Dialog_talk_work48,I know a guy who drank too much Quantum Nuka-Cola. Later we used him as Christmas tree.
Dialog_talk_work49,"Sometimes, I think it's a mistake to expose our presence on the radio."
Dialog_talk_work50,Thanks to the Overseer. It's easier to work here than anywhere else.
Dialog_talk_work51,"The more places I explored, the better I think the Vault is."
Dialog_talk_work52,I don't if anyone would listen to my radio. At least I will...
Dialog_talk_assist1,"Your place is good, much better than mine."
Dialog_talk_assist2,It's good to taste something new in other Diners. I'll be glad to be sent here again next time.
Dialog_talk_Handy01,"Auto-collection activating... Good, now we have stable power storage again, Overseer."
Dialog_talk_Handy02,"What? Oh... Don't worry, Overseer, I don't need charging."
Dialog_talk_Handy03,Warning! Fusing detected at the Fusion Power Plant!... Just a joke. Relax.
Dialog_talk_Handy04,"Your power storage looks fine, Overseer. But perhaps you should charge your profile processor."
Dialog_talk_Handy05,"Auto-collection activating... These purified water resources are critical to the Vault, Overseer."
Dialog_talk_Handy06,"I don't get rusty, Overseer. My body is made of titanium alloy."
Dialog_talk_Handy07,"Purifier Chip? Ha! Overseer, nobody uses it any more."
Dialog_talk_Handy08,(Alarm sounding with Geiger Counter) What? Don't worry. These water resources are pure and safe to drink.
Dialog_talk_Handy09,"Auto-collection activating... The delicious food is ready, Overseer."
Dialog_talk_Handy10,"Overseer, if you could be driven by atom like me, you wouldn't worry about your stomach ache."
Dialog_talk_Handy11,"Overseer, trust my cooking skill. No robot ever said my dinner is bad..."
Dialog_talk_Handy12,"Does radiation makes food taste better? Overseer, pardon me, I think you have things more important to consider."
Dialog_talk_Handy13,"Auto-collection activating... Ah, we get more Caps, Overseer."
Dialog_talk_Handy14,Perhaps I'll never understand why Caps are used as the currency in the Wasteland. Maybe I'm but a dumb robot.
Dialog_talk_Handy15,Why are we making Caps instead of Nuka-Cola? It's a question.
Dialog_talk_Handy16,"Overseer, do you like the sound of Caps? I can record it and make it your alarm."

There was a fierce battle!\n I wonder what happened to those combatants.\n I guess they were all killed by the Deathclaws... Because there is no surviving Deathclaws!

Loc_Audio_Sound_BroadCast_KKD_Random07,"Lisa, did you hear? Near the Red Rocket Truck Stop, I saw someone sneaking around...\nAh? Really? What did he look like?\nI'm sure of it! I didn't see his face. It was strange. He just disappeared.\nAh! That's weird! Who could it be? Could it be a raider?!\nDon't know... Lisa, you better stay vigilant!\nYes, will do!"
Loc_Audio_Sound_BroadCast_LKXD_Random08,"The Minutemen, where on earth did they come from? What's their angle?\nWe can trust them because they really are helping us! I know they rescued a Dweller from raiders!\nNo! It could be a trick! It's just a show! They want to control us!\nI don't think so! They're passionate and friendly. They helped me fix my house. That can't be faked.\nYes, I trust them. They protected the Dwellers and got rid of raiders and monsters alike. It can't be a trick.\nThat's why I say you're all naive. It's a trap they've set! You know! A trap!\nI suppose that's your own problem. You don't like dealing with others.\nYes! That's right! You should change your attitude!\nYou idiots! Helpless imbeciles!"
Loc_Audio_Sound_BroadCast_BSDX_Random01,"Shirley, I'd like to take a trip to Diamond City, will you go with me?\nSure, that sounds great! I heard they've got some new arrivals. I'd like to have a look at their shops too.\nThen it's settled. I'll come pick you up.\nNo problem."
Loc_Audio_Sound_BroadCast_BSDX_Random02,What on earth do you want? I have nothing left!\nKeep lying. We're on to you! We've been watching you!\nSo what? The point is that I got nothing left! Synths took everything from me!\n...Hold... Hold on... What? What Synths? Are you kidding?!\nI'm telling the truth! A bunch of Synths robbed me!\n...Blasted Synths! Stealing away my business! I must deal with them!

Loc_Audio_Sound_BroadCast_BSDX_Random12,"Where shall we meet today?\nYou decide...\nHow about Diamond City?\nNo, it's gross there. Then the Hardware Town?\nFor what? There might be raiders...\nWell, so how about Back Street Apparel?\nIt's too far...and tiring.\nSo where do you want to meet?\nAnywhere, you decide..."
Loc_Audio_Sound_BroadCast_BSDD_Random01,"I'm going to have a look around Concord.\nConcord? What for?

I'll consider it..."
Loc_Audio_Sound_BroadCast_BSDD_Random04,"Speaking of, what do you make of this Railroad and the rumors about them?\nUm, seriously, I can hardly believe the Railroad exists.\nWhy?\nThink about it.

Loc_Audio_Sound_BroadCast_BSDD_Random06,I heard many people came out from a Vault recently...\nReally? Where did you get that information?\nI have my sources.\nHumph... Quit joking.

Loc_Audio_Sound_BroadCast_BSDD_Random11,"How's it going lately?\nI don't know... I just went for a walk. I don't know what to do.\nDid anyone see you, or recognize you?\nI suppose not. We look the same, after all. \nThen what's next?\n...I...don't have the foggiest... I feel a bit lost..."

What are we waiting for?\nWe will no longer worry about the purifier! Keep it in mind! No.41 Street!"
